A little bit of a woman came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Athwart my path one day;</span><br />
So tiny was she that she seemed to be<br />
A pixy strayed from the misty sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or a wandering greenwood fay.</span><br />
<br />
"Oho, you little elf!" I cried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"And what are you doing here?</span><br />
So tiny as you will never do<br />
For the brutal rush and hullaballoo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this practical world, I fear."</span><br />
<br />
"Voice have I, good sir," said she.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'Tis soft as an Angel's sigh,</span><br />
But to fancy a word of yours were heard<br />
In all the din of this world's absurd!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiling, I made reply.</span><br />
<br />
"Hands have I, good sir" she quoth.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Marry, and that have you!</span><br />
But amid the strife and the tumult rife<br />
In all the struggle and battle for life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What can those wee hands do?"</span><br />
<br />
"Eyes have I, good sir," she said.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sooth, you have," quoth I,</span><br />
"And tears shall flow therefrom, I trow,<br />
And they betimes shall dim with woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the hard, hard years go by!"</span>

That little bit of a woman cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her two eyes full on me,</span><br />
And they smote me sore to my inmost core,<br />
And they hold me slaved forevermore,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet would I not be free!</span><br />
<br />
That little bit of a woman's hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reached up into my breast</span><br />
And rent apart my scoffing heart,&mdash;<br />
And they buffet it still with such sweet art<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As cannot be expressed.</span><br />
<br />
That little bit of a woman's voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath grown most wondrous dear;</span><br />
Above the blare of all elsewhere<br />
(An inspiration that mocks at care)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It riseth full and clear.</span><br />
<br />
Dear one, I bless the subtle power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That makes me wholly thine;</span><br />
And I'm proud to say that I bless the day<br />
When a little woman wrought her way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into this life of mine!</span><br /></div>

<h2>FATHER'S WAY.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
MY father was no pessimist; he loved the things of earth,&mdash;<br />
Its cheerfulness and sunshine, its music and its mirth.<br />
He never sighed or moped around whenever things went wrong,&mdash;<br />
I warrant me he'd mocked at fate with some defiant song;<br />
But, being he warn't much on tune, when times looked sort o' blue,<br />
He'd whistle softly to himself this only tune he knew,&mdash;<br /></div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">

<div class='poem2'>
Now mother, when she heard that tune which father whistled so,<br />
Would say, "There's something wrong to-day with Ephraim, I know;<br />
He never tries to make believe he's happy that 'ere way<br />
But that I'm certain as can be there's somethin' wrong to pay."<br />
And so betimes, quite natural-like, to us observant youth<br />
There seemed suggestion in that tune of deep, pathetic truth.<br />
<br />
When Brother William joined the war, a lot of us went down<br />
To see the gallant soldier boys right gayly out of town.<br />
A-comin' home, poor mother cried as if her heart would break,<br />
And all us children, too,&mdash;for <i>hers</i>, and <i>not</i> for <i>William's</i> sake!<br />
But father, trudgin' on ahead, his hands behind him so,<br />
Kept whistlin' to himself, so sort of solemn-like and low.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><br />
And when my oldest sister, Sue, was married and went West,<br />
Seemed like it took the tuck right out of mother and the rest.<br />
She was the sunlight in our home,&mdash;why, father used to say<br />
It wouldn't seem like home at all if Sue should go away;<br />
But when she went, a-leavin' us all sorrer and all tears,<br />
Poor father whistled lonesome-like&mdash;and went to feed the steers.<br />
<br />
When crops were bad, and other ills befell our homely lot,<br />
He'd set of nights and try to act as if he minded not;<br />
And when came death and bore away the one he worshipped so,<br />
How vainly did his lips belie the heart benumbed with woe!<br />
You see the telltale whistle told a mood he'd not admit,&mdash;<br />
He'd always stopped his whistlin' when he thought we noticed it.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
I'd like to see that stooping form and hoary head again,&mdash;<br />
To see the honest, hearty smile that cheered his fellow-men.<br />
Oh, could I kiss the kindly lips that spake no creature wrong,<br />
And share the rapture of the heart that overflowed with song!<br />
Oh, could I hear the little tune he whistled long ago,<br />
When he did battle with the griefs he would not have <i>us</i> know!<br />

HOW fair you are, my mother!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, though 't is many a year</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since you were here,</span><br />
Still do I see your beauteous face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the glow</span><br />
Of your dark eyes cometh a grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of long ago.</span><br />
So gentle, too, my mother!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as of old, upon my brow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like benedictions now,</span><br />
Falleth your dear hand's touch;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And still, as then,</span><br />
A voice that glads me over-much<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cometh again,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">My fair and gentle mother!</span><br />
<br />
How you have loved me, mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have not power to tell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing full well</span><br />
That even in the rest above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is your will</span><br />
To watch and guard me with your love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Loving me still.</span><br />
And, as of old, my mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am content to be a child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By mother's love beguiled</span><br />
From all these other charms;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So to the last</span><br />
Within thy dear, protecting arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hold thou me fast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My guardian angel, mother!</span><br />

<h2>K&Ouml;RNER'S BATTLE PRAYER.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">FATHER, I cry to Thee!</span><br />
Round me the billows of battle are pouring,<br />
Round me the thunders of battle are roaring;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Father on high, hear Thou my cry,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, oh, lead Thou me!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, oh, lead Thou me!</span><br />
Lead me, o'er Death and its terrors victorious,&mdash;<br />
See, I acknowledge Thy will as all-glorious;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Point Thou the way, lead where it may,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God, I acknowledge Thee!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God, I acknowledge Thee!</span><br />
As when the dead leaves of autumn whirl round me,<br />
So, when the horrors of war would confound me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Laugh I at fear, knowing Thee near,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, oh, bless Thou me!</span><br />

Such as I am, I commit to Thy keeping:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frail though I be, Lord, bless Thou me!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, I worship Thee!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, I worship Thee!</span><br />
Not for the love of the riches that perish,<br />
But for the freedom and justice we cherish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stand we or fall, blessing Thee, all&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God, I submit to Thee!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">God, I submit to Thee!</span><br />
Yea, though the terrors of Death pass before me,<br />
Yea, with the darkness of Death stealing o'er me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord, unto Thee bend I the knee,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Father, I cry to Thee!</span><br />

<h2>GOSLING STEW.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
IN Oberhausen, on a time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I fared as might a king;</span><br />
And now I feel the muse sublime<br />
Inspire me to embalm in rhyme<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That succulent and sapid thing</span><br />
Behight of gentile and of Jew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
The good Herr Schmitz brought out his best,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soup, cutlet, salad, roast,&mdash;</span><br />
And I partook with hearty zest,<br />
And fervently anon I blessed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That generous and benignant host,</span><br />
When suddenly dawned on my view<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">A gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
I sniffed it coming on apace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as its odors filled</span><br />
The curious little dining-place,<br />
I felt a glow suffuse my face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I felt my very marrow thrilled</span><br />
With rapture altogether new,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">'Twas gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
These callow birds had never played<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In yonder village pond;</span><br />
Had never through the gateway strayed,<br />
And plaintive spissant music made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the grassy green beyond:</span><br />
Cooped up, they simply ate and grew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
My doctor said I mustn't eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High food and seasoned game;</span><br />
But surely gosling is a meat<br />
With tender nourishment replete.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leastwise I gayly ate this same;</span><br />
I braved dyspepsy&mdash;wouldn't you<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">For gosling stew?</span><br />
<br />
I've feasted where the possums grow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Roast turkey have I tried,</span><br />
The joys of canvasbacks I know,<br />
And frequently I've eaten crow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In bleak and chill Novembertide;</span><br />
I'd barter all that native crew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
And when from Rhineland I adjourn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To seek my Yankee shore,</span><br />
Back shall my memory often turn,<br />
And fiercely shall my palate burn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For sweets I'll taste, alas! no more,&mdash;</span><br />
Oh, that mein kleine frau could brew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A gosling stew!</span><br />
<br />
Vain are these keen regrets of mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vain the song I sing;</span><br />
Yet would I quaff a stoup of wine<br />
To Oberhausen auf der Rhine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where fared I like a very king:</span><br />
And here's a last and fond adieu<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To gosling stew!</span><br />

COME, my Lesbia, no repining;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us love while yet we may!</span><br />
Suns go on forever shining;<br />

Sleep perpetual shall o'ertake us,<br />
And no morrow's dawn awake us.<br />

Come, in yonder nook reclining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the honeysuckle climbs,</span><br />
Let us mock at Fate's designing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us kiss a thousand times!</span><br />
And if they shall prove too few, dear,<br />
When they're kissed we'll start anew, dear!<br />
<br />
And should any chance to see us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goodness! how they'll agonize!</span><br />
How they'll wish that they could be us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissing in such liberal wise!</span><br />
Never mind their envious whining;<br />
Come, my Lesbia, no repining!<br />

<h2>JOHN SMITH.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
TO-DAY I strayed in Charing Cross, as wretched as could be,<br />
With thinking of my home and friends across the tumbling sea;<br />
There was no water in my eyes, but my spirits were depressed,<br />
And my heart lay like a sodden, soggy doughnut in my breast.<br />
This way and that streamed multitudes, that gayly passed me by;<br />
Not one in all the crowd knew me, and not a one knew I.<br />
"Oh for a touch of home!" I sighed; "oh for a friendly face!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Oh for a hearty hand-clasp in this teeming, desert place!"<br />
And so soliloquizing, as a homesick creature will,<br />
Incontinent, I wandered down the noisy, bustling hill,<br />
And drifted, automatic-like and vaguely, into Lowe's,<br />
Where Fortune had in store a panacea for my woes.<br />
The register was open, and there dawned upon my sight<br />
A name that filled and thrilled me with a cyclone of delight,&mdash;<br />
The name that I shall venerate unto my dying day,&mdash;<br />
The proud, immortal signature: "John Smith, U. S. A."<br />
<br />
Wildly I clutched the register, and brooded on that name;<br />
I knew John Smith, yet could not well identify the same.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>I knew him North, I knew him South, I knew him East and West;<br />
I knew him all so well I knew not which I knew the best.<br />
His eyes, I recollect, were gray, and black, and brown, and blue;<br />
And when he was not bald, his hair was of chameleon hue;<br />
Lean, fat, tall, short, rich, poor, grave, gay, a blonde, and a brunette,&mdash;<br />
Aha, amid this London fog, John Smith, I see you yet!<br />
I see you yet; and yet the sight is all so blurred I seem<br />
To see you in composite, or as in a waking dream.<br />
Which are you, John? I'd like to know, that I might weave a rhyme<br />
Appropriate to your character, your politics, and clime.<br />
So tell me, were you "raised" or "reared"? your pedigree confess<br />
In some such treacherous ism as "I reckon" or "I guess."<br />
Let fall your telltale dialect, that instantly I may<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Identify my countryman, "John Smith, U. S. A."<br />
<br />
It's like as not you air the John that lived aspell ago<br />
Deown East, where codfish, beans, 'nd <i>bona-fide</i> schoolma'ams grow;<br />
Where the dear old homestead nestles like among the Hampshire hills,<br />
And where the robin hops about the cherry-boughs 'nd trills;<br />
Where Hubbard squash 'nd huckleberries grow to powerful size,<br />
And everything is orthodox from preachers down to pies;<br />
Where the red-wing blackbirds swing 'nd call beside the pickril pond,<br />
And the crows air cawin' in the pines uv the pasture lot beyond;<br />
Where folks complain uv bein' poor, because their money's lent<br />
Out West on farms 'nd railroads at the rate uv ten per cent;<br />
Where we ust to spark the Baker girls a-comin' home from choir,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Or a-settin' namin' apples round the roarin' kitchen fire;<br />
Where we had to go to meetin' at least three times a week,<br />
And our mothers learnt us good religious Dr. Watts to speak;<br />
And where our grandmas sleep their sleep&mdash;God rest their souls, I say;<br />
And God bless yours, ef you're that John, "John Smith, U. S. A."<br />
<br />
Or, mebbe, Col. Smith, yo' are the gentleman I know<br />
In the country whar the finest Democrats 'nd hosses grow;<br />
Whar the ladies are all beautiful, an' whar the crap of cawn<br />
Is utilized for Burbon, and true awters are bawn.<br />
You've ren for jedge, and killed yore man, and bet on Proctor Knott;<br />
Yore heart is full of chivalry, yore skin is full of shot;<br />
And I disremember whar I've met with gentlemen so true<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>As yo' all in Kaintucky, whar blood an' grass are blue,<br />
Whar a niggah with a ballot is the signal fo' a fight,<br />
Whar the yaller dawg pursues the coon throughout the bammy night,<br />
Whar blooms the furtive possum,&mdash;pride an' glory of the South!<br />
And anty makes a hoe-cake, sah, that melts within yo' mouth,<br />
Whar all night long the mockin'-birds are warblin' in the trees,<br />
And black-eyed Susans nod and blink at every passing breeze,<br />
Whar in a hallowed soil repose the ashes of our Clay,&mdash;<br />
H'yar's lookin' at yo', Col. "John Smith, U. S. A."<br />
<br />
Or wuz you that John Smith I knew out yonder in the West,&mdash;<br />
That part of our Republic I shall always love the best!<br />
Wuz you him that went prospectin' in the spring of '69<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>In the Red Hoss Mountain country for the Gosh-all-Hemlock mine?<br />
Oh, how I'd liked to clasped your hand, an' set down by your side,<br />
And talked about the good old days beyond the Big Divide,&mdash;<br />
Of the rackaboar, the snaix, the bear, the Rocky Mountain goat,<br />
Of the conversazzhyony, 'nd of Casey's tabble-dote,<br />
And a word of them old pardners that stood by us long ago,&mdash;<br />
Three-fingered Hoover, Sorry Tom, and Parson Jim, you know!<br />
Old times, old friends, John Smith, would make our hearts beat high again,<br />
And we'd see the snow-top mountains like we used to see 'em then;<br />
The magpies would go flutterin' like strange sperrits to 'nd fro,<br />
And we'd hear the pines a-singin' in the ragged gulch below;<br />
And the mountain brook would loiter like upon its windin' way,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Ez if it waited for a child to jine it in its play.<br />
You see, John Smith, just which you are I cannot well recall;<br />
And, really, I am pleased to think you somehow must be all!<br />
For when a man sojourns abroad awhile, as I have done,<br />
He likes to think of all the folks he left at home as one.<br />
And so they are,&mdash;for well you know there's nothing in a name;<br />
Our Browns, our Joneses, and our Smiths are happily the same,&mdash;<br />
All represent the spirit of the land across the sea;<br />
All stand for one high purpose in our country of the free.<br />
Whether John Smith be from the South, the North, the West, the East,<br />
So long as he's American, it mattereth not the least;<br />
Whether his crest be badger, bear, palmetto, sword, or pine,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>His is the glory of the stars that with the stripes combine.<br />
Where'er he be, whate'er his lot, he's eager to be known,<br />
Not by his mortal name, but by his country's name alone;<br />
And so, compatriot, I am proud you wrote your name to-day<br />
Upon the register at Lowe's, "John Smith, U. S. A."<br />

<h2>ST. MARTIN'S LANE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ST. MARTIN'S LANE winds up the hill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And trends a devious way;</span><br />
I walk therein amid the din<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of busy London day:</span><br />
I walk where wealth and squalor meet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And think upon a time</span><br />
When others trod this saintly sod,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And heard St. Martin's chime.</span><br />
<br />
But when those solemn bells invoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The midnight's slumbrous grace,</span><br />
The ghosts of men come back again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To haunt that curious place:</span><br />
The ghosts of sages, poets, wits,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come back in goodly train;</span><br />
And all night long, with mirth and song,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">They walk St. Martin's Lane.</span><br />
<br />
There's Jerrold paired with Thackeray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Maginn and Thomas Moore,</span><br />
And here and there and everywhere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fraserians by the score;</span><br />
And one wee ghost that climbs the hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is welcomed with a shout,&mdash;</span><br />
No king could be revered as he,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The <i>padre</i>, Father Prout!</span><br />
<br />
They banter up and down the street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clamor at the door</span><br />
Of yonder inn, which once has been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The scene of mirth galore:</span><br />
'Tis now a lonely, musty shell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Deserted, like to fall;</span><br />
And Echo mocks their ghostly knocks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And iterates their call.</span><br />
<br />
Come back, thou ghost of ruddy host,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Pluto's misty shore;</span><br />
Renew to-night the keen delight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of by-gone years once more;</span><br />
Brew for this merry, motley horde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And serve the steaming cheer;</span><br />
And grant that I may lurk hard by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To see the mirth, and hear.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, me! I dream what things may seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To others childish vain,</span><br />
And yet at night 'tis my delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To walk St. Martin's Lane;</span><br />
For, in the light of other days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I walk with those I love,</span><br />
And all the time St. Martin's chime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes piteous moan above.</span><br />

<h2>THE SINGING IN GOD'S ACRE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
OUT yonder in the moonlight, wherein God's Acre lies,<br />
Go angels walking to and fro, singing their lullabies.<br />
Their radiant wings are folded, and their eyes are bended low,<br />
As they sing among the beds whereon the flowers delight to grow,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Sleep, oh, sleep!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The Shepherd guardeth His sheep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fast speedeth the night away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soon cometh the glorious day;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleep, weary ones, while ye may,&mdash;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sleep, oh, sleep!"</span><br />
<br />
The flowers within God's Acre see that fair and wondrous sight,<br />
And hear the angels singing to the sleepers through the night;<br />
And, lo! throughout the hours of day those gentle flowers prolong<br />
The music of the angels in that tender slumber-song,&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Sleep, oh, sleep!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The Shepherd loveth His sheep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He that guardeth His flock the best</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath folded them to His loving breast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So sleep ye now, and take your rest,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Sleep, oh, sleep!"</span><br />
<br />
From angel and from flower the years have learned that soothing song,<br />
And with its heavenly music speed the days and nights along;<br />
So through all time, whose flight the Shepherd's vigils glorify,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>God's Acre slumbereth in the grace of that sweet lullaby,&mdash;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The Shepherd loveth His sheep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fast speedeth the night away,</span><br />

<h2>DEAR OLD LONDON.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN I was broke in London in the fall of '89,<br />
I chanced to spy in Oxford Street this tantalizing sign,&mdash;<br />
"A Splendid Horace cheap for Cash!" Of course I had to look<br />
Upon the vaunted bargain, and it was a noble book!<br />
A finer one I've never seen, nor can I hope to see,&mdash;<br />
The first edition, richly bound, and clean as clean can be;<br />
And, just to think, for three-pounds-ten I might have had that Pine,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>When I was broke in London in the fall of '89!<br />
<br />
Down at Noseda's, in the Strand, I found, one fateful day,<br />
A portrait that I pined for as only maniac may,&mdash;<br />
A print of Madame Vestris (she flourished years ago,<br />
Was Bartolozzi's daughter and a thoroughbred, you know).<br />
A clean and handsome print it was, and cheap at thirty bob,&mdash;<br />
That's what I told the salesman, as I choked a rising sob;<br />
But I hung around Noseda's as it were a holy shrine,<br />
When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.<br />
<br />
At Davey's, in Great Russell Street, were autographs galore,<br />
And Mr. Davey used to let me con that precious store.<br />
Sometimes I read what warriors wrote, sometimes a king's command,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>But oftener still a poet's verse, writ in a meagre hand.<br />
Lamb, Byron, Addison, and Burns, Pope, Johnson, Swift, and Scott,&mdash;<br />
It needed but a paltry sum to comprehend the lot;<br />
Yet, though Friend Davey marked 'em down, what could I but decline?<br />
For I was broke in London in the fall of '89.<br />
<br />
Of antique swords and spears I saw a vast and dazzling heap<br />
That Curio Fenton offered me at prices passing cheap;<br />
And, oh, the quaint old bureaus, and the warming-pans of brass,<br />
And the lovely hideous freaks I found in pewter and in glass!<br />
And, oh, the sideboards, candlesticks, the cracked old china plates,<br />
The clocks and spoons from Amsterdam that antedate all dates!<br />
Of such superb monstrosities I found an endless mine<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.<br />
<br />
O ye that hanker after boons that others idle by,&mdash;<br />
The battered things that please the soul, though they may vex the eye,&mdash;<br />
The silver plate and crockery all sanctified with grime,<br />
The oaken stuff that has defied the tooth of envious Time,<br />
The musty tomes, the speckled prints, the mildewed bills of play,<br />
And other costly relics of malodorous decay,&mdash;<br />
Ye only can appreciate what agony was mine<br />
When I was broke in London in the fall of '89.<br />
<br />
When, in the course of natural things, I go to my reward,<br />
Let no imposing epitaph my martyrdoms record;<br />

<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
BAMBINO in his cradle slept;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by his side his grandam grim</span><br />
Bent down and smiled upon the child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sung this lullaby to him,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This "ninna and anninia":</span><br />

"When thou art older, thou shalt mind<br />

And thou shalt go where roses blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And balmy waters singing glide&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
"And thou shalt wear, trimmed up in points,<br />

And, more than that, a peaked hat,<br />

<h2>THE CLINK OF THE ICE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
NOTABLY fond of music, I dote on a sweeter tone<br />
Than ever the harp has uttered or ever the lute has known.<br />
When I wake at five in the morning with a feeling in my head<br />
Suggestive of mild excesses before I retired to bed;<br />
When a small but fierce volcano vexes me sore inside,<br />
And my throat and mouth are furred with a fur that seemeth a buffalo hide,&mdash;<br />
How gracious those dews of solace that over my senses fall<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>At the clink of the ice in the pitcher the boy brings up the hall!<br />
<br />
Oh, is it the gaudy ballet, with features I cannot name,<br />
That kindles in virile bosoms that slow but devouring flame?<br />
Or is it the midnight supper, eaten before we retire,<br />
That presently by combustion setteth us all afire?<br />
Or is it the cheery magnum?&mdash;nay, I'll not chide the cup<br />
That makes the meekest mortal anxious to whoop things up:<br />
Yet, what the cause soever, relief comes when we call,&mdash;<br />
Relief with that rapturous clinkety-clink that clinketh alike for all.<br />
<br />
I've dreamt of the fiery furnace that was one vast bulk of flame,<br />
And that I was Abednego a-wallowing in that same;<br />
And I've dreamt I was a crater, possessed of a mad desire<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>To vomit molten lava, and to snort big gobs of fire;<br />
I've dreamt I was Roman candles and rockets that fizzed and screamed,&mdash;<br />
In short, I have dreamt the cussedest dreams that ever a human dreamed:<br />
But all the red-hot fancies were scattered quick as a wink<br />
When the spirit within that pitcher went clinking its clinkety-clink.<br />
<br />
Boy, why so slow in coming with that gracious, saving cup?<br />
Oh, haste thee to the succor of the man who is burning up!<br />
See how the ice bobs up and down, as if it wildly strove<br />
To reach its grace to the wretch who feels like a red-hot kitchen stove!<br />
The piteous clinks it clinks methinks should thrill you through and through:<br />
An erring soul is wanting drink, and he wants it p. d. q.!<br />
And, lo! the honest pitcher, too, falls in so dire a fret<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>That its pallid form is presently bedewed with a chilly sweat.<br />
<br />
May blessings be showered upon the man who first devised this drink<br />
That happens along at five <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> with its rapturous clinkety-clink!<br />
I never have felt the cooling flood go sizzling down my throat<br />
But what I vowed to hymn a hymn to that clinkety-clink devote;<br />
So now, in the prime of my manhood, I polish this lyric gem<br />
For the uses of all good fellows who are thirsty at five <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>,<br />
But specially for those fellows who have known the pleasing thrall<br />
Of the clink of the ice in the pitcher the boy brings up the hall.<br />

<h2>THE BELLS OF NOTRE DAME.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WHAT though the radiant thoroughfare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Teems with a noisy throng?</span><br />
What though men bandy everywhere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ribald jest and song?</span><br />
Over the din of oaths and cries<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Broodeth a wondrous calm,</span><br />
And mid that solemn stillness rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The bells of Notre Dame.</span><br />
<br />
"Heed not, dear Lord," they seem to say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Thy weak and erring child;</span><br />
And thou, O gentle Mother, pray<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That God be reconciled;</span><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those bells of Notre Dame.</span><br />
<br />
And so, methinks, God, bending down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To ken the things of earth,</span><br />
Heeds not the mockery of the town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or cries of ribald mirth;</span><br />
For ever soundeth in His ears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A penitential psalm,&mdash;</span><br />
'T is thy angelic voice He hears,<br />

<br />
Plead on, O bells, that thy sweet voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May still forever be</span><br />
An intercession to rejoice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Benign divinity;</span><br />
And that thy tuneful grace may fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like dew, a quickening balm,</span><br />
Upon the arid hearts of all,<br />

<h2>LOVER'S LANE, SAINT JO.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
SAINT JO, Buchanan County,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is leagues and leagues away;</span><br />
And I sit in the gloom of this rented room,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pine to be there to-day.</span><br />
Yes, with London fog around me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the bustling to and fro,</span><br />
I am fretting to be across the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo.</span><br />
<br />
I would have a brown-eyed maiden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Go driving once again;</span><br />
And I'd sing the song, as we snailed along,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That I sung to that maiden then:</span><br />
I purposely say, "as we <i>snailed</i> along,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a proper horse goes slow</span><br />
In those leafy aisles, where Cupid smiles,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo.</span><br />
<br />
From her boudoir in the alders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would peep a lynx-eyed thrush,</span><br />
And we'd hear her say, in a furtive way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the noisy cricket, "Hush!"</span><br />
To think that the curious creature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should crane her neck to know</span><br />
The various things one says and sings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo!</span><br />
<br />
But the maples they should shield us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the gossips of the place;</span><br />
Nor should the sun, except by pun,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Profane the maiden's face;</span><br />
And the girl should do the driving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a fellow can't, you know,</span><br />
Unless he's neglectful of what's quite respectful<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! sweet the hours of springtime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the heart inclines to woo,</span><br />
And it's deemed all right for the callow wight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To do what he wants to do;</span><br />
But cruel the age of winter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the way of the world says no</span><br />
To the hoary men who would woo again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo!</span><br />
<br />
In the Union Bank of London<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are forty pounds or more,</span><br />
Which I'm like to spend, ere the month shall end,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In an antiquarian store;</span><br />
But I'd give it all, and gladly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If for an hour or so</span><br />
I could feel the grace of a distant place,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Lover's Lane, Saint Jo.</span><br />
<br />
Let us sit awhile, beloved,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dream of the good old days,&mdash;</span><br />
Of the kindly shade which the maples made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round the stanch but squeaky chaise;</span><br />
With your head upon my shoulder,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my arm about you so,</span><br />
Though exiles, we shall seem to be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Lover's Lane, Saint Jo.</span><br />

<h2>CRUMPETS AND TEA.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
THERE are happenings in life that are destined to rise<br />
Like dear, hallowed visions before a man's eyes;<br />
And the passage of years shall not dim in the least<br />
The glory and joy of our Sabbath-day feast,&mdash;<br />
The Sabbath-day luncheon that's spread for us three,&mdash;<br />
My worthy companions, Teresa and Leigh,<br />
And me, all so hungry for crumpets and tea.<br />
<br />
There are cynics who say with invidious zest<br />
That a crumpet's a thing that will never digest;<br />
But I happen to <i>know</i> that a crumpet is prime<br />
For digestion, if only you give it its time.<br />
Or if, by a chance, it should <i>not</i> quite agree,<br />
Why, who would begrudge a physician his fee<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>For plying his trade upon crumpets and tea?<br />
<br />
To toast crumpets quite <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, I require<br />
A proper long fork and a proper quick fire;<br />
And when they are browned, without further ado,<br />
I put on the butter, that soaks through and through.<br />
And meantime Teresa, directed by Leigh,<br />
Compounds and pours out a rich brew for us three;<br />
And so we sit down to our crumpets&mdash;and tea.<br />
<br />
A hand-organ grinds in the street a weird bit,&mdash;<br />
Confound those Italians! I wish they would quit<br />
Interrupting our feast with their dolorous airs,<br />
Suggestive of climbing the heavenly stairs.<br />
(It's thoughts of the future, as all will agree,<br />
That we fain would dismiss from our bosoms when we<br />
Sit down to discussion of crumpets and tea!)<br />
<br />
The Sabbath-day luncheon whereof I now speak<br />
Quite answers its purpose the rest of the week;<br />
Yet with the next Sabbath I wait for the bell<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Announcing the man who has crumpets to sell;<br />
Then I scuttle downstairs in a frenzy of glee,<br />
And purchase for sixpence enough for us three,<br />
Who hunger and hanker for crumpets and tea.<br />
<br />
But soon&mdash;ah! too soon&mdash;I must bid a farewell<br />
To joys that succeed to the sound of that bell,<br />
Must hie me away from the dank, foggy shore<br />
That's filled me with colic and&mdash;yearnings for more!<br />
Then the cruel, the heartless, the conscienceless sea<br />
Shall bear me afar from Teresa and Leigh<br />
And the other twin friendships of crumpets and tea.<br />
<br />
Yet often, ay, ever, before my wan eyes<br />
That Sabbath-day luncheon of old shall arise.<br />
My stomach, perhaps, shall improve by the change,<br />
Since crumpets it seems to prefer at long range;<br />
But, oh, how my palate will hanker to be<br />
In London again with Teresa and Leigh,<br />
Enjoying the rapture of crumpets and tea!<br />

THROUGH all my life the poor shall find<br />

In all their walks the lame shall know<br />

And on the deaf will I bestow<br />

WILLIE and Bess, Georgie and May,&mdash;<br />
Once as these children were hard at play,<br />
An old man, hoary and tottering, came<br />
And watched them playing their pretty game.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He seemed to wonder, while standing there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What the meaning thereof could be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Aha, but the old man yearned to share</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the little children's innocent glee,</span><br />
As they circled around with laugh and shout,<br />
And told this rhyme at counting out:<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>Ah, the mirth of that summer day!<br />
'Twas Father Time who had come to share<br />
The innocent joy of those children there.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And into their sport with them went he,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How <i>could</i> the children have been afraid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since little they recked who he might be?</span><br />
They laughed to hear old Father Time<br />
Mumbling that curious nonsense rhyme<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of intry-mintry, cutrey-corn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Apple-seed and apple-thorn,</span><br />

<br />
Willie and Bess, Georgie and May,<br />
And joy of summer,&mdash;where are they?<br />
The grim old man still standeth near,<br />
Crooning the song of a far-off year;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And into the winter I come alone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cheered by that mournful requiem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soothed by the dolorous monotone</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">That shall count me off as it counted them,&mdash;</span><br />

Chanting the homely nursery rhyme<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When, with "apple-seed and apple-thorn,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Life was full of the dulcet cheer</span><br />

<h2>MODJESKY AS CAMEEL.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
AFORE we went to Denver we had heerd the Tabor Grand,<br />
Allowed by critics ez the finest opry in the land;<br />
And, roundin' up at Denver in the fall of '81,<br />
Well heeled in p'int uv looker 'nd a-pinin' for some fun,<br />
We told Bill Bush that we wuz fixed quite comf'table for wealth,<br />
And hadn't struck that altitood entirely for our health.<br />
You see we knew Bill Bush at Central City years ago;<br />
(An' a whiter man than that same Bill you could not wish to know!)<br />
Bill run the Grand for Tabor, 'nd he gin us two a deal<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>Ez how we really otter see Modjesky ez Cameel.<br />
<br />
Three-Fingered Hoover stated that he'd great deal ruther go<br />
To call on Charley Sampson than frequent a opry show.<br />
"The queen uv tradegy," sez he, "is wot I've never seen,<br />
And I reckon there is more for <i>me</i> in some other kind uv queen."<br />
"Git out!" sez Bill, disgusted-like, "and can't you never find<br />
A pleasure in the things uv life wich ellervates the mind?<br />
You've set around in Casey's restawraw a year or more,<br />
An' heerd ol' Vere de Blaw perform shef doovers by the score,<br />
Only to come down here among us <i>tong</i> an' say you feel<br />
You'd ruther take in faro than a opry like 'Cameel'!"<br />
<br />
But it seems it wurn't no opry, but a sort uv foreign play,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>With a heap uv talk an' dressin' that wuz both de<i>kolly</i>tay.<br />
A young chap sparks a gal, who's caught a dook that's old an' wealthy,&mdash;<br />
She has a cold 'nd faintin' fits, and is gin'rally onhealthy.<br />
She says she has a record; but the young chap doesn't mind,<br />
And it looks ez if the feller wuz a proper likely kind<br />
Until his old man sneaks around 'nd makes a dirty break,<br />
And the young one plays the sucker 'nd gives the girl the shake.<br />
"Armo! Armo!" she hollers; but he flings her on the floor,<br />
And says he ainter goin' to have no truck with her no more.<br />
<br />
At that Three-Fingered Hoover says, "I'll chip into this game,<br />
And see if Red Hoss Mountain cannot reconstruct the same.<br />
I won't set by an' see the feelin's uv a lady hurt,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Gol durn a critter, anyhow, that does a woman dirt!"<br />
He riz up like a giant in that little painted pen,<br />
And stepped upon the platform with the women-folks 'nd men;<br />
Across the trough of gaslights he bounded like a deer,<br />
An' grabbed Armo an' hove him through the landscape in the rear;<br />
And then we seen him shed his hat an' reverently kneel,<br />
An' put his strong arms tenderly around the gal Cameel.<br />
<br />
A-standin' in his stockin' feet, his height wuz six foot three,<br />
And a huskier man than Hoover wuz you could not hope to see.<br />
He downed Lafe Dawson wrasslin'; and one night I seen him lick<br />
Three Cornish miners that come into camp from Roarin' Crick<br />
To clean out Casey's restawraw an' do the town, they said.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>He could whip his weight in wildcats, an' paint whole townships red,<br />
But good to helpless folks and weak,&mdash;a brave and manly heart<br />
A cyclone couldn't phase, but any child could rend apart;<br />
Jest like the mountain pine, wich dares the storm that howls along,<br />
But rocks the winds uv summer-time, an' sings a soothin' song.<br />
<br />
"Cameel," sez he, "your record is ag'in you, I'll allow,<br />
But, bein' you're a woman, you'll git justice anyhow;<br />
So, if you say you're sorry, and intend to travel straight,&mdash;<br />
Why, never mind that other chap with which you meant to mate,&mdash;<br />
I'll marry you myself, and take you back to-morrow night<br />
To the camp on Red Hoss Mountain, where the boys'll treat you white,<br />
Where Casey runs a tabble dote, and folks are brave 'nd true,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Where there ain't no ancient history to bother me or you,<br />
Where there ain't no law but honesty, no evidence but facts,<br />
Where between the verdick and the rope there ain't no <i>onter acts</i>."<br />
<br />
I wuz mighty proud of Hoover; but the folks began to shout<br />
That the feller was intrudin', and would some one put him out.<br />
"Well, no; I reckon not," says I, or words to that effect,<br />
Ez I perduced a argument I thought they might respect,&mdash;<br />
A long an' harnsome weepon I'd pre-empted when I come<br />
Out West (its cartridges wuz big an' juicy ez a plum),<br />
Wich, when persented properly, wuz very apt to sway<br />
The popular opinion in a most persuasive way.<br />
"Well, no; I reckon not," says I; but I didn't say no more,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>Observin' that there wuz a ginral movement towards the door.<br />
<br />
First Dr. Lemen he allowed that he had got to go<br />
And see a patient he jest heerd wuz lyin' very low;<br />
An' Charlie Toll riz up an' said he guessed he'd jine the Dock,<br />
An' go to see a client wich wuz waitin' round the block;<br />
John Arkins reckollected he had interviews to write,<br />
And previous engagements hurried Cooper from our sight;<br />
Cal Cole went out to buy a hoss, Fred Skiff and Belford too;<br />
And Stapleton remembered he had heaps uv work to do.<br />
Somehow or other every one wuz full of business then;<br />
Leastwise, they all vamoosed, and didn't bother us again.<br />
<br />
I reckollect that Willard Morse an' Bush come runnin' in,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>A-hollerin', "Oh, wot two idiots you durned fools have been!"<br />
I reckollect that they allowed we'd made a big mistake,&mdash;<br />
They otter knowed us tenderfoots wuz sure to make a break!<br />
An', while Modjesky stated we wuz somewhat off our base,<br />
I half opined she liked it, by the look upon her face.<br />
I reckollect that Hoover regretted he done wrong<br />
In throwin' that there actor through a vista ten miles long.<br />
I reckollect we all shuck hands, and ordered vin frappay,&mdash;<br />
And I never shall forget the head I had on me next day!<br />
<br />
I haven't seen Modjesky since; I'm hopin' to again.<br />
She's goin' to show in Denver soon; I'll go to see her then.<br />
An' may be I shall speak to her, wich if I do 'twill be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>About the old friend restin' by the mighty Western sea,&mdash;<br />
A simple man, perhaps, but good ez gold and true ez steel;<br />
He could whip his weight in wildcats, and you never heerd him squeal;<br />
Good to the helpless and the weak; a brave an' manly heart<br />
A cyclone couldn't phase, but any child could rend apart;<br />
So like the mountain pine, that dares the storm wich sweeps along,<br />
But rocks the winds uv summer-time, an' sings a soothin' song.<br />

<h2>TELLING THE BEES.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
OUT of the house where the slumberer lay<br />
Grandfather came one summer day,<br />
And under the pleasant orchard trees<br />
He spake this wise to the murmuring bees:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"The clover-bloom that kissed her feet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the posie-bed where she used to play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have honey store, but none so sweet</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As ere our little one went away.</span><br />
O bees, sing soft, and, bees, sing low;<br />
For she is gone who loved you so."<br />
<br />
A wonder fell on the listening bees<br />
Under those pleasant orchard trees,<br />
And in their toil that summer day<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Ever their murmuring seemed to say:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Child, O child, the grass is cool,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the posies are waking to hear the song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the bird that swings by the shaded pool,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Waiting for one that tarrieth long."</span><br />
'Twas so they called to the little one then,<br />
As if to call her back again.<br />
<br />
O gentle bees, I have come to say<br />
That grandfather fell asleep to-day,<br />
And we know by the smile on grandfather's face<br />
He has found his dear one's biding-place.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So, bees, sing soft, and, bees, sing low,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As over the honey-fields you sweep,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the trees abloom and the flowers ablow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing of grandfather fast asleep;</span><br />
And ever beneath these orchard trees<br />
Find cheer and shelter, gentle bees.<br />

<h2>THE TEA-GOWN.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
MY lady has a tea-gown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That is wondrous fair to see,&mdash;</span><br />
It is flounced and ruffed and plaited and puffed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a tea-gown ought to be;</span><br />
And I thought she must be jesting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Last night at supper when</span><br />
She remarked, by chance, that it came from France,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And had cost but two pounds ten.</span><br />
<br />
Had she told me fifty shillings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I might (and wouldn't you?)</span><br />
Have referred to that dress in a way folks express<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By an eloquent dash or two;</span><br />
But the guileful little creature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knew well her tactics when</span><br />
She casually said that that dream in red<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had cost but two pounds ten.</span><br />
<br />
Yet our home is all the brighter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that dainty, sensient thing,</span><br />
That floats away where it properly may,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clings where it ought to cling;</span><br />
And I count myself the luckiest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all us married men</span><br />
That I have a wife whose joy in life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a gown at two pounds ten.</span><br />
<br />
It isn't the gown compels me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Condone this venial sin;</span><br />
It's the pretty face above the lace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the gentle heart within.</span><br />
And with her arms about me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I say, and say again,</span><br />
"'Twas wondrous cheap,"&mdash;and I think a heap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that gown at two pounds ten!</span><br />

<h2>DOCTORS.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
'Tis quite the thing to say and sing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gross libels on the doctor,&mdash;</span><br />
To picture him an ogre grim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or humbug-pill concocter;</span><br />
Yet it's in quite another light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My friendly pen would show him,</span><br />
Glad that it may with verse repay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some part of what I owe him.</span><br />
<br />
When one's all right, he's prone to spite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The doctor's peaceful mission;</span><br />
But when he's sick, it's loud and quick<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He bawls for a physician.</span><br />
With other things, the doctor brings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet babes, our hearts to soften:</span><br />
Though I have four, I pine for more,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Good doctor, pray come often!</span><br />
<br />
What though he sees death and disease<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Run riot all around him?</span><br />
Patient and true, and valorous too,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such have I always found him.</span><br />
Where'er he goes, he soothes our woes;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when skill's unavailing,</span><br />
And death is near, his words of cheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Support our courage failing.</span><br />
<br />
In ancient days they used to praise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The godlike art of healing,&mdash;</span><br />
An art that then engaged all men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Possessed of sense and feeling.</span><br />
Why, Raleigh, he was glad to be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Famed for a quack elixir;</span><br />
And Digby sold, as we are told,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A charm for folk lovesick, sir.</span><br />
<br />
Napoleon knew a thing or two,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clearly <i>he</i> was partial</span><br />
To doctors, for in time of war<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">He chose one for a marshal.</span><br />
In our great cause a doctor was<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The first to pass death's portal,</span><br />
And Warren's name at once became<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A beacon and immortal.</span><br />
<br />
A heap, indeed, of what we read<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By doctors is provided;</span><br />
For to those groves Apollo loves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their leaning is decided.</span><br />
Deny who may that Rabelais<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is first in wit and learning,</span><br />
And yet all smile and marvel while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His brilliant leaves they're turning.</span><br />
<br />
How Lever's pen has charmed all men!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How touching Rab's short story!</span><br />
And I will stake my all that Drake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is still the schoolboy's glory.</span><br />
A doctor-man it was began<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great Britain's great museum,&mdash;</span><br />
The treasures there are all so rare<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>It drives me wild to see 'em!<br />
<br />
There's Cuvier, Parr, and Rush; they are<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Big monuments to learning.</span><br />
To Mitchell's prose (how smooth it flows!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We all are fondly turning.</span><br />
Tomes might be writ of that keen wit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which Abernethy's famed for;</span><br />
With bread-crumb pills he cured the ills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Most doctors now get blamed for.</span><br />
<br />
In modern times the noble rhymes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Holmes, a great physician,</span><br />
Have solace brought and wisdom taught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hearts of all condition.</span><br />
The sailor, bound for Puget Sound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Finds pleasure still unfailing,</span><br />
If he but troll the barcarole<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Osborne wrote on Whaling.</span><br />
<br />
If there were need, I could proceed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Ad naus.</i> with this prescription,</span><br />
But, <i>inter nos</i>, a larger dose<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Might give you fits conniption;</span><br />
Yet, ere I end, there's one dear friend<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd hold before these others,</span><br />
For he and I in years gone by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have chummed around like brothers.</span><br />
<br />
Together we have sung in glee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The songs old Horace made for</span><br />
Our genial craft, together quaffed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What bowls that doctor paid for!</span><br />
I love the rest, but love him best;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, were not times so pressing,</span><br />
I'd buy and send&mdash;you smile, old friend?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Well, then, here goes my blessing.</span><br />

<h2>BARBARA.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
BLITHE was the youth that summer day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he smote at the ribs of earth,</span><br />
And he plied his pick with a merry click,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he whistled anon in mirth;</span><br />
And the constant thought of his dear one's face<br />
Seemed to illumine that ghostly place.<br />
<br />
The gaunt earth envied the lover's joy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she moved, and closed on his head:</span><br />
With no one nigh and with never a cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beautiful boy lay dead;</span><br />
And the treasure he sought for his sweetheart fair<br />
Crumbled, and clung to his glorious hair.<br />
<br />
Fifty years is a mighty space<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the human toil for bread;</span><br />
But to Love and to Death 'tis merely a breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dream that is quickly sped,&mdash;</span><br />
Fifty years, and the fair lad lay<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Just as he fell that summer day.<br />
<br />
At last came others in quest of gold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hewed in that mountain place;</span><br />
And deep in the ground one time they found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boy with the smiling face:</span><br />
All uncorrupt by the pitiless air,<br />
He lay, with his crown of golden hair.<br />
<br />
They bore him up to the sun again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laid him beside the brook,</span><br />
And the folk came down from the busy town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wonder and prate and look;</span><br />
And so, to a world that knew him not,<br />
The boy came back to the old-time spot.<br />
<br />
Old Barbara hobbled among the rest,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrinkled and bowed was she,&mdash;</span><br />
And she gave a cry, as she fared anigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"At last he is come to me!"</span><br />
And she kneeled by the side of the dead boy there,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>And she kissed his lips, and she stroked his hair.<br />
<br />
"Thine eyes are sealed, O dearest one!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And better it is 'tis so,</span><br />
Else thou mightst see how harsh with me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dealt Life thou couldst not know:</span><br />
Kindlier Death has kept <i>thee</i> fair;<br />
The sorrow of Life hath been <i>my</i> share."<br />
<br />
Barbara bowed her aged face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fell on the breast of her dead;</span><br />
And the golden hair of her dear one there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Caressed her snow-white head.</span><br />
Oh, Life is sweet, with its touch of pain;<br />
But sweeter the Death that joined those twain.<br />

<h2>THE CAF&Eacute; MOLINEAU.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE Caf&eacute; Molineau is where<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dainty little minx</span><br />
Serves God and man as best she can<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By serving meats and drinks.</span><br />
Oh, such an air the creature has,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And such a pretty face!</span><br />
I took delight that autumn night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In hanging round the place.</span><br />
<br />
I know but very little French<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(I have not long been here);</span><br />
But when she spoke, her meaning broke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full sweetly on my ear.</span><br />
Then, too, she seemed to understand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whatever I'd to say,</span><br />
Though most I knew was "oony poo,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Bong zhoor," and "see voo play."</span><br />
<br />
The female wit is always quick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of all womankind</span><br />
'Tis here in France that you, perchance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The keenest wits shall find;</span><br />
And here you'll find that subtle gift,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rare, distinctive touch,</span><br />
Combined with grace of form and face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That glads men overmuch.</span><br />
<br />
"Our girls at home," I mused aloud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Lack either that or this;</span><br />
They don't combine the arts divine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As does the Gallic miss.</span><br />
Far be it from me to malign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our belles across the sea,</span><br />
And yet I'll swear none can compare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With this ideal She."</span><br />
<br />
And then I praised her dainty foot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In very awful French,</span><br />
And parleyvood in guileful mood<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until the saucy wench</span><br />
Tossed back her haughty auburn head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And froze me with disdain:</span><br />
"There are on me no flies," said she,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"For I come from Bangor, Maine!"</span><br />

<h2>THE BOLTONS, 22.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN winter nights are grewsome, and the heavy, yellow fog<br />
Gives to Piccadilly semblance of a dank, malarious bog;<br />
When a demon, with companion in similitude of bell,<br />
Goes round informing people he has crumpets for to sell;<br />
When a weird, asthmatic minstrel haunts your door for hours along,<br />
Until you've paid him tu'pence for the thing he calls a song,&mdash;<br />
When, in short, the world's against you, and you'd give that world, and more,<br />
To lay your weary heart at rest upon your native shore,<br />
There's happily one saving thing for you and yours to do:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>Go call on Isaac Henderson, The Boltons, 22.<br />
<br />
The place is all so cheery and so warm I love to spend<br />
My evenings in communion with the genial host, my friend.<br />
One sees <i>chefs d'&#339;uvre</i> of masters in profusion on the walls,<br />
And a monster canine swaggers up and down the spacious halls;<br />
There are divers things of beauty to astound, instruct, and please,<br />
And everywhere assurance of contentment and of ease:<br />
But best of all the gentle hearts I meet with in the place,&mdash;<br />
The host's good-fellowship, his wife's sincere and modest grace;<br />
Why, if there be cordiality that warms you through and through,<br />
It's found at Isaac Henderson's, The Boltons, 22.<br />
<br />
My favorite room's the study that is on the second floor;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>And there we sit in judgment on men and things galore.<br />
The fire burns briskly in the grate, and sheds a genial glare<br />
On me, who most discreetly have pre-empted Isaac's chair,&mdash;<br />
A big, low chair, with grateful springs, and curious device<br />
To keep a fellow's cerebellum comf'table and nice,<br />
A shade obscures the functions of the stately lamp, in spite<br />
Of Mrs. Henderson's demands for somewhat more of light;<br />
But he and I demur, and say a mystic gloom will do<br />
For winter-night communion at The Boltons, 22.<br />
<br />
Sometimes he reads me Browning, or from Bryant culls a bit,<br />
And sometimes plucks a gem from Hood's philosophy and wit;<br />
And oftentimes I tell him yarns, and (what I fear is worse)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Recite him sundry specimens of woolly Western verse.<br />
And while his muse and mine transcend the bright Horatian's stars,<br />
He smokes his modest pipe, and I&mdash;I smoke his choice cigars!<br />
For best of mild Havanas this considerate host supplies,&mdash;<br />
The proper brand, the proper shade, and quite the proper size;<br />
And so I buckle down and smoke and smoke,&mdash;and so will you,<br />
If ever you're invited to The Boltons, 22.<br />
<br />
But, oh! the best of worldly joys is as a dream short-lived:<br />
'Tis twelve o'clock, and Robinson reports our cab arrived.<br />
A last libation ere we part, and hands all round, and then<br />
A cordial invitation to us both to come again.<br />
So home through Piccadilly and through Oxford Street we jog,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>On slippery, noisy pavements and in blinding, choking fog,&mdash;<br />
The same old route through Circus, Square, and Quadrant we retrace,<br />
Till we reach the princely mansion known as 20 Alfred Place;<br />
And then we seek our feathery beds of cotton to renew<br />
In dreams the sweet distractions of The Boltons, 22.<br />
<br />
God bless you, good friend Isaac, and your lovely, gracious wife;<br />
May health and wealth attend you, and happiness, through life;<br />
And as you sit of evenings that quiet room within,<br />
Know that in spirit I shall be your guest as I have been.<br />

<h2>DIBDIN'S GHOST.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
DEAR wife, last midnight, whilst I read<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tomes you so despise,</span><br />
A spectre rose beside the bed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spake in this true wise:</span><br />
"From Canaan's beatific coast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've come to visit thee,</span><br />
For I am Frognall Dibdin's ghost,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dibdin's ghost to me.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
I bade him welcome, and we twain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Discussed with buoyant hearts</span><br />
The various things that appertain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To bibliomaniac arts.</span><br />
"Since you are fresh from t' other side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pray tell me of that host</span><br />
That treasured books before they died,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says I to Dibdin's ghost.</span><br />
<br />
"They've entered into perfect rest;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For in the life they've won</span><br />
There are no auctions to molest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No creditors to dun.</span><br />
Their heavenly rapture has no bounds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside that jasper sea;</span><br />
It is a joy unknown to Lowndes,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dibdin's ghost to me.</span><br />
<br />
Much I rejoiced to hear him speak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of biblio-bliss above,</span><br />
For I am one of those who seek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What bibliomaniacs love.</span><br />
"But tell me, for I long to hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What doth concern me most,</span><br />
Are wives admitted to that sphere?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says I to Dibdin's ghost.</span><br />
<br />
"The women folk are few up there;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For 'twere not fair, you know,</span><br />
That they our heavenly joy should share<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who vex us here below.</span><br />
The few are those who have been kind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To husbands such as we;</span><br />
They knew our fads, and didn't mind,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dibdin's ghost to me.</span><br />
<br />
"But what of those who scold at us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we would read in bed?</span><br />
Or, wanting victuals, make a fuss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If we buy books instead?</span><br />
And what of those who've dusted not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our motley pride and boast,&mdash;</span><br />
Shall they profane that sacred spot?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says I to Dibdin's ghost.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, no! they tread that other path,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which leads where torments roll,</span><br />
And worms, yes, bookworms, vent their wrath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the guilty soul.</span><br />
Untouched of bibliomaniac grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That saveth such as we,</span><br />
They wallow in that dreadful place,"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says Dibdin's ghost to me.</span><br />
<br />
"To my dear wife will I recite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What things I've heard you say;</span><br />
She'll let me read the books by night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's let me buy by day.</span><br />
For we together by and by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would join that heavenly host;</span><br />
She's earned a rest as well as I,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Says I to Dibdin's ghost.</span><br />

<h2>THE HAWTHORNE CHILDREN.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE Hawthorne children, seven in all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are famous friends of mine;</span><br />
And with what pleasure I recall<br />
How, years ago, one gloomy fall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I took a tedious railway line,</span><br />
And journeyed by slow stages down<br />
Unto that soporiferous town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(Albeit one worth seeing)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Hildegarde, John, Henry, Fred,</span><br />
And Beatrix and Gwendolen,<br />
And she that was the baby then,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These famous seven, as aforesaid,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lived, moved, and had their being.</span><br />
<br />
The Hawthorne children gave me such<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A welcome by the sea</span><br />
That the eight of us were soon in touch,<br />
And, though their mother marvelled much,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Happy as larks were we.</span><br />
Egad, I was a boy again<br />
With Henry, John, and Gwendolen;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And oh the funny capers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I cut with Hildegarde and Fred!</span><br />
And oh the pranks we children played;<br />
And oh the deafening noise we made&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Twould shock my family if they read</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About it in the papers!</span><br />
<br />
The Hawthorne children all were smart:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The girls, as I recall,</span><br />
Had comprehended every art<br />
Appealing to the head and heart;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boys were gifted, all.</span><br />
'Twas Hildegarde who showed me how<br />
To hitch a horse and milk a cow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And cook the best of suppers;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Beatrix upon the sands</span><br />
I sprinted daily, and was beat;<br />
'Twas Henry trained me to the feat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of walking round upon my hands</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Instead of on my uppers.</span><br />
<br />
The Hawthorne children liked me best<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of evenings, after tea,</span><br />
For then, by general request,<br />
I spun them yarns about the West,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yarns all involving Me!</span><br />
I represented how I'd slain<br />
The bison on his native plain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And divers tales of wonder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I told of how I'd fought and bled</span><br />
In Indian scrimmages galore,<br />
Till Mrs. Hawthorne quoth, "No more,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And packed her darlings off to bed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To dream of blood and thunder.</span><br />
<br />
They must have changed a deal since then;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The misses, tall and fair,</span><br />
And those three handsome, lusty men,&mdash;<br />
Would they be girls and boys again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were I to happen there,</span><br />
Down in that spot beside the sea<br />
Where we made such tumultuous glee<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">That dull autumnal weather?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, me! the years go swiftly by;</span><br />
And yet how fondly I recall<br />
The week when we were children all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear Hawthorne children, you and I,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Just eight of us together!</span><br />

<h2>THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
ONCE on a time a friend of mine prevailed on me to go<br />
To see the dazzling splendors of a sinful ballet show;<br />
And after we had revelled in the saltatory sights,<br />
We sought a neighboring <i>caf&eacute;</i> for more tangible delights.<br />
When I demanded of my friend what viands he preferred,<br />
He quoth: "A large cold bottle, and a small hot bird!"<br />
<br />
Fool that I was, I did not know what anguish hidden lies<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Within the morceau that allures the nostrils and the eyes!<br />
There is a glorious candor in an honest quart of wine,<br />
A certain inspiration which I cannot well define!<br />
How it bubbles, how it sparkles, how its gurgling seems to say:<br />
"Come! on a tide of rapture let me float your soul away!"<br />
<br />
But the crispy, steaming mouthful that is spread upon your plate,&mdash;<br />
How it discounts human sapience and satirizes fate!<br />
You wouldn't think a thing so small could cause the pains and aches<br />
That certainly accrue to him that of that thing partakes;<br />
To me, at least, (a guileless wight!) it never once occurred<br />
What horror was encompassed in that small hot bird.<br />
<br />
Oh, what a head I had on me when I awoke next day,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>And what a firm conviction of intestinal decay!<br />
What seas of mineral water and of bromide I applied<br />
To quench those fierce volcanic fires that rioted inside!<br />
And oh the thousand solemn, awful vows I plighted then<br />
Never to tax my system with a small hot bird again!<br />
<br />
The doctor seemed to doubt that birds could worry people so,<br />
But, bless him! since I ate the bird, I guess I ought to know!<br />
The acidous condition of my stomach, so he said,<br />
Bespoke a vinous irritant that amplified my head,<br />
And, ergo, the causation of the thing, as he inferred,<br />
Was the large cold bottle,&mdash;<i>not</i> the small hot bird.<br />
<br />
Of course I know it wasn't, and I'm sure you'll say I'm right<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>If ever it has been your wont to train around at night.<br />
How sweet is retrospection when one's heart is bathed in wine,<br />
And before its balmy breath how do the ills of life decline!<br />
How the gracious juices drown what griefs would vex a mortal breast,<br />
And float the flattered soul into the port of dreamless rest!<br />
<br />
But you, O noxious, pygmy bird! whether it be you fly,<br />
Or paddle in the stagnant pools that sweltering festering lie,&mdash;<br />
I curse you and your evil kind for that you do me wrong,<br />
Engendering poisons that corrupt my petted muse of song;<br />
Go, get thee hence! and never more discomfit me and mine,&mdash;<br />
I fain would barter all thy brood for one sweet draught of wine!<br />
<br />
So hither come, O sportive youth! when fades the telltale day,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Come hither, with your fillets and your wreaths of posies gay;<br />
We shall unloose the fragrant seas of seething, frothing wine<br />
Which now the cobwebbed glass and envious wire and corks confine,<br />
And midst the pleasing revelry the praises shall be heard<br />
Of the large cold bottle,&mdash;<i>not</i> the small hot bird!<br />

Tityrus, all in the shade of the wide-spreading beech-tree reclining,<br />

Exiles from home, you beguile our hearts from their hopeless repining,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you sing Amaryllis the while in pastorals tuneful and tender.</span><br />
</div></div>


<div class='center'><br /><br />TITYRUS.</div>

<div class='poem3'>
A god&mdash;yes, a god, I declare&mdash;vouchsafes me these pleasant conditions,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And often I gayly repair with a tender white lamb to his altar;</span><br />
He gives me the leisure to play my greatly admired compositions,<br />

I do not begrudge you repose; I simply admit I'm confounded<br />

To exile and hardship devote, and by merciless enemies hounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I drag at this wretched old goat and coax on my famishing cattle.</span><br />
Oh, often the omens presaged the horrors which now overwhelm me&mdash;<br />
But, come, if not elsewise engaged, who <i>is</i> this good deity, tell me!<br />

The city&mdash;the city called Rome, with my head full of herding and tillage,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I used to compare with my home, these pastures wherein you now wander;</span><br />
But I didn't take long to find out that the city surpasses the village<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the cypress surpasses the sprout that thrives in the thicket out yonder.</span><br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MELIB&#338;US.</div>

<div class='poem3'>
Tell me, good gossip, I pray, what led you to visit the city?<br />

<div class='poem3'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Liberty! which on a day regarded my lot with compassion;</span><br />
My age and distresses, forsooth, compelled that proud mistress to pity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That had snubbed the attentions of youth in most reprehensible fashion.</span><br />
Oh, happy, thrice happy, the day when the cold Galatea forsook me;<br />
And equally happy, I say, the hour when that other girl took me!<br />
</div>


<div class='center'><br /><br />MELIB&#338;US (slyly, as if addressing the damsel).</div>

<div class='poem3'>
So now, Amaryllis, the truth of your ill-disguised grief I discover!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You pined for a favorite youth with cityfied damsels hobnobbing;</span><br />
And soon your surroundings partook of your grief for your recusant lover,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pine-trees, the copse and the brook, for Tityrus ever went sobbing.</span><br />

<div class='poem3'>
Melib&#339;us, what else could I do? Fate doled me no morsel of pity;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My toil was all vain the year through, no matter how earnest or clever,</span><br />
Till, at last, came that god among men, that king from that wonderful city,<br />

Dear cottage wherein I was born! shall another in conquest possess thee,<br />

<h2>PITTYPAT AND TIPPYTOE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ALL day long they come and go,&mdash;<br />
Pittypat and Tippytoe;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Footprints up and down the hall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Playthings scattered on the floor,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Finger-marks along the wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tell-tale streaks upon the door,&mdash;</span><br />
By these presents you shall know<br />
Pittypat and Tippytoe.<br />
<br />
How they riot at their play!<br />
And, a dozen times a day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In they troop, demanding bread,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Only buttered bread will do,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that butter must be spread</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Inches thick with sugar too!</span><br />
Never yet have I said, "No,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>Pittypat and Tippytoe!"<br />
<br />
Sometimes there are griefs to soothe,<br />
Sometimes ruffled brows to smooth;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tippytoe and Pittypat</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sometimes interrupt their play</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With an internecine spat;</span><br />
Fie! oh, fie! to quarrel so,<br />
Pittypat and Tippytoe!<br />
<br />
Oh, the thousand worrying things<br />
Every day recurrent brings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hands to scrub and hair to brush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Search for playthings gone amiss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Many a murmuring to hush,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Many a little bump to kiss;</span><br />
Life's indeed a fleeting show,<br />
Pittypat and Tippytoe!<br />
<br />
And when day is at an end,<br />
There are little duds to mend;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little frocks are strangely torn,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Little shoes great holes reveal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little hose, but one day worn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rudely yawn at toe or heel!</span><br />
Who but you could work such woe,<br />
Pittypat and Tippytoe!<br />
<br />
But when comes this thought to me,<br />
"Some there are that childless be,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stealing to their little beds,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a love I cannot speak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tenderly I stroke their heads,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fondly kiss each velvet cheek.</span><br />
God help those who do not know<br />
A Pittypat or Tippytoe!<br />
<br />
On the floor, along the hall,<br />
Rudely traced upon the wall,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the havoc they have wrought;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And upon my heart you'd find</span><br />

<h2>ASHES ON THE SLIDE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN Jim and Bill and I were boys a many years ago.<br />
How gayly did we use to hail the coming of the snow!<br />
Our sleds, fresh painted red and with their runners round and bright,<br />
Seemed to respond right briskly to our clamor of delight<br />
As we dragged them up the slippery road that climbed the rugged hill<br />
Where perched the old frame meetin'-house, so solemn-like and still.<br />
<br />
Ah, coasting in those days&mdash;those good old days&mdash;was fun indeed!<br />
Sleds at that time I'd have you know were paragons of speed!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>And if the hill got bare in spots, as hills will do, why then<br />
We'd haul on ice and snow to patch those bald spots up again;<br />
But, oh! with what sad certainty our spirits would subside<br />
When Deacon Frisbee sprinkled ashes where we used to slide!<br />
<br />
The deacon he would roll his eyes and gnash his toothless gums,<br />
And clear his skinny throat, and twirl his saintly, bony thumbs,<br />
And tell you: "When I wuz a boy, they taught me to eschew<br />
The godless, ribald vanities which modern youth pursue!<br />
The pathway that leads down to hell is slippery, straight, and wide;<br />
And Satan lurks for prey where little boys are wont to slide!"<br />
<br />
Now, he who ever in his life has been a little boy<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>Will not reprove me when he hears the language I employ<br />
To stigmatize as wickedness the deacon's zealous spite<br />
In interfering with the play wherein we found delight;<br />
And so I say, with confidence, not unalloyed of pride:<br />
"Gol durn the man who sprinkles ashes where the youngsters slide!"<br />
<br />
But Deacon Frisbee long ago went to his lasting rest,<br />
His money well invested in farm mortgages out West;<br />
Bill, Jim, and I, no longer boys, have learned through years of strife<br />
That the troubles of the little boy pursue the man through life;<br />
That here and there along the course wherein we hoped to glide<br />
Some envious hand has sprinkled ashes just to spoil our slide!<br />
<br />
And that malicious, envious hand is not the deacon's now.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Grim, ruthless Fate, that evil sprite none other is than thou!<br />
Riches and honors, peace and care come at thy beck and go;<br />
The soul, elate with joy to-day, to-morrow writhes in woe;<br />
And till a man has turned his face unto the wall and died,<br />
He must expect to get his share of ashes on his slide!<br />

<h2>CARLSBAD.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
DEAR Palmer, just a year ago we did the Carlsbad cure,<br />
Which, though it be exceeding slow, is as exceeding sure;<br />
To corpulency you were prone, dyspepsia bothered me,&mdash;<br />
You tipped the beam at twenty stone and I at ten stone three!<br />
The cure, they told us, works both ways: it makes the fat man lean;<br />
The thin man, after many days, achieves a portly mien;<br />
And though it 's true you still are fat, while I am like a crow,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>All skin and feathers,&mdash;what of that? The cure takes time, you know.<br />
<br />
The Carlsbad scenery is sublime,&mdash;that's what the guide-books say;<br />
We did not think so at that time, nor think <i>I</i> so to-day!<br />
The bluffs that squeeze the panting town permit no pleasing views,<br />
But weigh the mortal spirits down and give a chap the blues.<br />
With nothing to amuse us then or mitigate our spleen,<br />
We rose and went to bed again, with three bad meals between;<br />
And constantly we made our moan,&mdash;ah, none so drear as we,<br />
When you were weighing twenty stone and I but ten stone three!<br />
<br />
We never scaled the mountain-side, for walking was my bane,<br />
And you were much too big to ride the mules that there obtain;<br />
And so we loitered in the shade with Israel out in force,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Or through the Pupp'sche allee strayed and heard the band discourse.<br />
Sometimes it pleased us to recline upon the Tepl's brink,<br />
Or watch the bilious human line file round to get a drink;<br />
Anon the portier's piping tone embittered you and me,<br />
When you were weighing twenty stone and I but ten stone three!<br />
<br />
And oh! those awful things to eat! No pudding, cake, or pie,<br />
But just a little dab of meat, and crusts absurdly dry;<br />
Then, too, that water twice a day,&mdash;one swallow was enough<br />
To take one's appetite away,&mdash;the tepid, awful stuff!<br />
Tortured by hunger's cruel stings, I 'd little else to do<br />
Than feast my eyes upon the things prescribed and cooked for you.<br />
The goodies went to you alone, the husks all fell to me,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>When you were weighing twenty stone and I weighed ten stone three.<br />
<br />
Yet happy days! and rapturous ills! and sweetly dismal date!<br />
When, sandwiched in between those hills, we twain bemoaned our fate.<br />
The little woes we suffered then like mists have sped away,<br />
And I were glad to share again those ills with you to-day,&mdash;<br />
To flounder in those rains of June that flood that Austrian vale,<br />
To quaff that tepid Kaiserbrunn and starve on victuals stale!<br />
And often, leagues and leagues away from where we suffered then,<br />
With envious yearnings I survey what cannot be again!<br />
<br />
And often in my quiet home, through dim and misty eyes,<br />
I seem to see that curhaus dome blink at the radiant skies;<br />
I seem to hear that Wiener band above the Tepl's roar,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>To feel the pressure of your hand and hear your voice once more;<br />
And, better yet, my heart is warm with thoughts of you and yours,<br />
For friendship hath a sweeter charm than thrice ten thousand cures!<br />
So I am happy to have known that time across the sea<br />
When you were weighing twenty stone and I weighed ten stone three.<br />

<h2>THE SUGAR-PLUM TREE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
HAVE you ever heard of the Sugar-Plum Tree?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a marvel of great renown!</span><br />
It blooms on the shore of the Lollipop Sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the garden of Shut-Eye Town;</span><br />
The fruit that it bears is so wondrously sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(As those who have tasted it say)</span><br />
That good little children have only to eat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that fruit to be happy next day.</span><br />
<br />
When you've got to the tree, you would have a hard time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To capture the fruit which I sing;</span><br />
The tree is so tall that no person could climb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the boughs where the sugar-plums swing!</span><br />
But up in that tree sits a chocolate cat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a gingerbread dog prowls below;</span><br />
And this is the way you contrive to get at<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those sugar-plums tempting you so:</span><br />
<br />
You say but the word to that gingerbread dog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he barks with such terrible zest</span><br />
That the chocolate cat is at once all agog,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As her swelling proportions attest.</span><br />
And the chocolate cat goes cavorting around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From <i>this</i> leafy limb unto <i>that</i>,</span><br />
And the sugar-plums tumble, of course, to the ground,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hurrah for that chocolate cat!</span><br />
<br />
There are marshmallows, gum-drops, and peppermint canes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With stripings of scarlet or gold,</span><br />
And you carry away of the treasure that rains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As much as your apron can hold!</span><br />
So come, little child, cuddle closer to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In your dainty white nightcap and gown,</span><br />
And I'll rock you away to that Sugar-Plum Tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the garden of Shut-Eye Town.</span><br />

<h2>RED.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
ANY color, so long as it's red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the color that suits me best,</span><br />
Though I will allow there is much to be said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For yellow and green and the rest;</span><br />
But the feeble tints which some affect<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the things they make or buy</span><br />
Have never&mdash;I say it with all respect&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appealed to my critical eye.</span><br />
<br />
There's that in red that warmeth the blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quickeneth a man within,</span><br />
And bringeth to speedy and perfect bud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The germs of original sin;</span><br />
So, though I'm properly born and bred,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll own, with a certain zest,</span><br />
That any color, so long as it's red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the color that suits me best.</span><br />
<br />
For where is a color that can compare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the blush of a buxom lass;</span><br />
Or where such warmth as of the hair<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the genuine white horse class?</span><br />
And, lo! reflected within this cup<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cheery Bordeaux I see</span><br />
What inspiration girdeth me up,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yes, red is the color for me!</span><br />
<br />
Through acres and acres of art I've strayed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Italy, Germany, France;</span><br />
On many a picture a master has made<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I've squandered a passing glance:</span><br />
Marines I hate, madonnas and<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those Dutch freaks I detest;</span><br />
But the peerless daubs of my native land,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They're red, and I like them best.</span><br />
<br />
'Tis little I care how folk deride,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm backed by the West, at least;</span><br />
And we are free to say that we can't abide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tastes that obtain down East;</span><br />
And we're mighty proud to have it said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That here in the versatile West</span><br />
Most any color, so long as it's red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the color that suits us best.</span><br />

MY harp is on the willow-tree,<br />
Else would I sing, O love, to thee<br />

Perchance the song that Miriam sung<br />
Ere yet Jud&aelig;a's heart was wrung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By centuries of woe.</span><br />
<br />
The shadow of those centuries lies<br />
Deep in thy dark and mournful eyes;<br />

And in the dreams that thou shalt dream<br />
The light of other days shall seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To glorify thy brow.</span><br />
<br />
I ate my crust in tears to-day,<br />
As, scourged, I went upon my way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And yet my darling smiled,&mdash;</span><br />
Ay, beating at my breast, he laughed;<br />
My anguish curdled not the draught,<br />

Our harp is on the willow-tree:<br />
I have no song to sing to thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As shadows round us roll;</span><br />
But, hush! and sleep, and thou shalt hear<br />
Jehovah's voice that speaks to cheer<br />

His girdle was horrent with pistols and things,<br />
And he nourished a handful of aces on kings.<br />

The fair Mariana sate watching a star,<br />
When who should turn up but the young Lochinvar!<br />

Then turned on the maiden a rapturous grin,<br />

Pre-empted the claim, and cleaned out the bar.<br />
Though the justice allowed he wa'n't wholly to blame,<br />
He taxed him ten dollars and costs, just the same.<br />

MY dolly is a dreadful care,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her name is Miss Amandy;</span><br />
I dress her up and curl her hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And feed her taffy candy.</span><br />
Yet, heedless of the pleading voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of her devoted mother,</span><br />
She will not wed her mother's choice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But says she'll wed another.</span><br />
<br />
I'd have her wed the china vase,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is no Dresden rarer;</span><br />
You might go searching every place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never find a fairer.</span><br />
He is a gentle, pinkish youth,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that there's no denying;</span><br />
Yet when I speak of him, forsooth!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amandy falls to crying.</span><br />
<br />
She loves the drum,&mdash;that's very plain,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scorns the vase so clever,</span><br />
And, weeping, vows she will remain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A spinster doll forever!</span><br />
The protestations of the drum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am convinced are hollow;</span><br />
When once distressing times should come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How soon would ruin follow!</span><br />
<br />
Yet all in vain the Dresden boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From yonder mantel woos her;</span><br />
A mania for that vulgar toy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The noisy drum, imbues her.</span><br />
In vain I wheel her to and fro,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And reason with her mildly:</span><br />
Her waxen tears in torrents flow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her sawdust heart beats wildly.</span><br />
<br />
I'm sure that when I'm big and tall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wear long trailing dresses,</span><br />
I sha'n't encourage beaux at all<br />

<h2>THE PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
UPON an average, twice a week,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When anguish clouds my brow,</span><br />
My good physician friend I seek<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To know "what ails me now."</span><br />
He taps me on the back and chest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scans my tongue for bile,</span><br />
And lays an ear against my breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And listens there awhile;</span><br />
Then is he ready to admit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all he can observe</span><br />
Is something wrong inside, to wit:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My pneumogastric nerve!</span><br />
<br />
Now, when these Latin names within<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dyspeptic hulks like mine</span><br />
Go wrong, a fellow should begin<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To draw what's called the line.</span><br />
It seems, however, that this same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which in my hulk abounds,</span><br />
Is not, despite its awful name,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So fatal as it sounds;</span><br />
Yet of all torments known to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll say without reserve,</span><br />
There is no torment like to thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou pneumogastric nerve!</span><br />
<br />
This subtle, envious nerve appears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be a patient foe,&mdash;</span><br />
It waited nearly forty years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its chance to lay me low;</span><br />
Then, like some blithering blast of hell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It struck this guileless bard,</span><br />
And in that evil hour I fell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Prodigious far and hard.</span><br />
Alas! what things I dearly love&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pies, puddings, and preserves&mdash;</span><br />
Are sure to rouse the vengeance of<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">All pneumogastric nerves!</span><br />
<br />
Oh that I could remodel man!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd end these cruel pains</span><br />
By hitting on a different plan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From that which now obtains.</span><br />
The stomach, greatly amplified,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anon should occupy</span><br />
The all of that domain inside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where heart and lungs now lie.</span><br />
But, first of all, I should depose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That diabolic curve</span><br />
And author of my thousand woes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pneumogastric nerve!</span><br />

<h2>TEENY-WEENY.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
EVERY evening, after tea,<br />
Teeny-Weeny comes to me,<br />
And, astride my willing knee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plies his lash and rides away;</span><br />
Though that palfrey, all too spare,<br />
Finds his burden hard to bear,<br />
Teeny-Weeny doesn't care,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He commands, and I obey!</span><br />
<br />
First it's trot; and gallop then,&mdash;<br />
Now it's back to trot again;<br />
Teeny-Weeny likes it when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is riding fierce and fast!</span><br />
Then his dark eyes brighter grow<br />
And his cheeks are all aglow,&mdash;<br />
"More!" he cries, and never "Whoa!"<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the horse breaks down at last!</span><br />
<br />
Oh, the strange and lovely sights<br />
Teeny-Weeny sees of nights,<br />
As he makes those famous flights<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that wondrous horse of his!</span><br />
Oftentimes, before he knows,<br />
Wearylike his eyelids close,<br />
And, still smiling, off he goes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the land of By-low is.</span><br />
<br />
There he sees the folk of fay<br />
Hard at ring-a-rosie play,<br />
And he hears those fairies say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Come, let's chase him to and fro!"</span><br />
But, with a defiant shout,<br />
Teeny puts that host to rout,&mdash;<br />
Of this tale I make no doubt,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every night he tells it so!</span><br />
<br />
So I feel a tender pride<br />
In my boy who dares to ride<br />
(That fierce horse of his astride)<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Off into those misty lands;</span><br />
And as on my breast he lies,<br />
Dreaming in that wondrous wise,<br />
I caress his folded eyes,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pat his little dimpled hands.</span><br />
<br />
On a time he went away,<br />
Just a little while to stay,<br />
And I'm not ashamed to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I was very lonely then;</span><br />
Life without him was so sad,<br />
You can fancy I was glad<br />
And made merry when I had<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Teeny-Weeny back again!</span><br />
<br />
So of evenings, after tea,<br />
When he toddles up to me<br />
And goes tugging at my knee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You should hear his palfrey neigh!</span><br />
You should see him prance and shy,<br />
When, with an exulting cry,<br />
Teeny-Weeny, vaulting high,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plies his lash and rides away!</span><br />

<h2>TELKA.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THROUGH those golden summer days<br />
Our twin flocks were wont to graze<br />
On the hillside, which the sun<br />
Rested lovingly upon,&mdash;<br />
Telka's flock and mine; and we<br />
Sung our songs in rapturous glee,<br />
Idling in the pleasant shade<br />
Which the solemn Yew-tree made,<br />
While the Brook anear us played,<br />
And a white Rose, ghost-like, grew<br />
In the shadow of the Yew.<br />
<br />
Telka loved me passing well;<br />
How I loved her none can tell!<br />
How I love her none may know,&mdash;<br />
Oh that man love woman so!<br />
When she was not at my side,<br />
Loud my heart in anguish cried,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>And my lips, till she replied.<br />
Yet they think to silence me,&mdash;<br />
As if love could silenced be!<br />
Fool were I, and fools were they!<br />
Still I wend my lonely way,<br />
"Telka," evermore I cry;<br />
Answer me the woods and sky,<br />
And the weary years go by.<br />
<br />
Telka, she was passing fair;<br />
And the glory of her hair<br />
Was such glory as the sun<br />
With his blessing casts upon<br />
Yonder lonely mountain height,<br />
Lifting up to bid good-night<br />
To her sovereign in the west,<br />
Sinking wearily to rest,<br />
Drowsing in that golden sea<br />
Where the realms of Dreamland be.<br />
<br />
So our love to fulness grew,<br />
Whilst beneath the solemn Yew<br />
Ghost-like paled the Rose of white,<br />
As it were some fancied sight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>Blanched it with a dread affright.<br />
<br />
Telka, she was passing fair;<br />
And our peace was perfect there<br />
Till, enchanted by her smile,<br />
Lurked the South Wind there awhile,<br />
Underneath that hillside tree<br />
Where with singing idled we,<br />
And I heard the South Wind say<br />
Flattering words to her that day<br />
Of a city far away.<br />
But the Yew-tree crouched as though<br />
It were like to whisper No<br />
To the words the South Wind said<br />
As he smoothed my Telka's head.<br />
And the Brook, all pleading, cried<br />
To the dear one at my side:<br />
"Linger always where I am;<br />
Stray not thence, O cosset lamb!<br />
Wander not where shadows deep<br />
On the treacherous quicksands sleep,<br />
And the haunted waters leap;<br />
Be thou ware the waves that flow<br />
Toward the prison pool below,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>Where, beguiled from yonder sky,<br />
Captive moonbeams shivering lie,<br />
And at dawn of morrow die."<br />
So the Brook to Telka cried,<br />
But my Telka naught replied;<br />
And, as in a strange affright,<br />
Paled the Rose a ghostlier white.<br />
<br />
When anon the North Wind came,&mdash;<br />
Rudely blustering Telka's name,<br />
And he kissed the leaves that grew<br />
Round about the trembling Yew,&mdash;<br />
Kissed and romped till, blushing red,<br />
All one day in terror fled,<br />
And the white Rose hung her head;<br />
Coming to our trysting spot,<br />
Long I called; she answered not.<br />
"Telka!" pleadingly I cried<br />
Up and down the mountain-side<br />
Where we twain were wont to bide.<br />
<br />
There were those who thought that I<br />
Could be silenced with a lie,<br />
And they told me Telka's name<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>Should be spoken now with shame:<br />
"She is lost to us and thee,"&mdash;<br />
That is what they said to me.<br />
<br />
"Is my Telka lost?" quoth I.<br />
"On this hilltop shall I cry,<br />
So that she may hear and then<br />
Find her way to me again.<br />
The South Wind spoke a lie that day;<br />
All deceived, she lost her way<br />
Yonder where the shadows sleep<br />
'Mongst the haunted waves that leap<br />
Over treacherous quicksands deep,<br />
And where captive moonbeams lie<br />
Doomed at morrow's dawn to die<br />
She is lost, and that is all;<br />
I will search for her, and call."<br />
<br />
Summer comes and winter goes,<br />
Buds the Yew and blooms the Rose;<br />
All the others are anear,&mdash;<br />
Only Telka is not here!<br />
Gone the peace and love I knew<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>Sometime 'neath the hillside Yew;<br />
And the Rose, that mocks me so,<br />
I had crushed it long ago<br />
But that Telka loved it then,<br />
And shall soothe its terror when<br />
She comes back to me again.<br />
Call I, seek I everywhere<br />
For my Telka, passing fair.<br />
It is, oh, so many a year<br />
I have called! She does not hear,<br />
Yet nor feared nor worn am I;<br />
For I know that if I cry<br />
She shall sometime hear my call.<br />
She is lost, and that is all,&mdash;<br />
She is lost in some far spot;<br />
I have searched, and found it not.<br />
Could she hear me calling, then<br />
Would she come to me again;<br />
For she loved me passing well,&mdash;<br />
How I love her none can tell!<br />
That is why these years I've cried<br />
"Telka!" on this mountain-side.<br />
"Telka!" still I, pleading, cry;<br />
Answer me the woods and sky,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>And the lonely years go by.<br />
<br />
On an evening dark and chill<br />
Came a shadow up the hill,&mdash;<br />
Came a spectre, grim and white<br />
As a ghost that walks the night,<br />
Grim and bowed, and with the cry<br />
Of a wretch about to die,&mdash;<br />
Came and fell and cried to me:<br />
"It is Telka come!" said she.<br />
So she fell and so she cried<br />
On that lonely mountain-side<br />
Where was Telka wont to bide.<br />
<br />
"Who hath bribed those lips to lie?<br />
Telka's face was fair," quoth I;<br />
"Thine is furrowed with despair.<br />
There is winter in thy hair;<br />
But upon her beauteous head<br />
Was there summer glory shed,&mdash;<br />
Such a glory as the sun,<br />
When his daily course is run,<br />
Smiles upon this mountain height<br />
As he kisses it good-night.<br />
There was music in her tone,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>Misery in thy voice alone.<br />
They have bid thee lie to me.<br />
Let me pass! Thou art not she!<br />
Let my sorrow sacred be<br />
Underneath this trysting tree!"<br />
<br />
So in wrath I went my way,<br />
And they came another day,&mdash;<br />
Came another day, and said:<br />
"Hush thy cry, for she is dead,<br />
Yonder on the mountain-side<br />
She is buried where she died,<br />
Where you twain were wont to bide,<br />
Where she came and fell and cried<br />
Pardon that thy wrath denied;<br />
And above her bosom grows<br />
As in mockery the Rose:<br />
It was white; but now 'tis red,<br />
And in shame it bows its head<br />
Over sinful Telka dead."<br />
<br />
So they thought to silence me,&mdash;<br />
As if love could silenced be!<br />
Fool were I, and fools were they!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Scornfully I went my way,<br />
And upon the mountain-side<br />
"Telka!" evermore I cried.<br />
"Telka!" evermore I cry;<br />
Answer me the woods and sky:<br />
So the lonely years go by.<br />
<br />
She is lost, and that is all;<br />
Sometime she shall hear my call,<br />
Hear my pleading call, and then<br />
Find her way to me again.<br />

<h2>PLAINT OF THE MISSOURI 'COON IN THE BERLIN ZO&Ouml;LOGICAL GARDENS.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
FRIEND, by the way you hump yourself you're from the States, I know,<br />
And born in old Mizzoorah, where the 'coons in plenty grow.<br />
I, too, am native of that clime; but harsh, relentless fate<br />
Has doomed me to an exile far from that noble State;<br />
And I, who used to climb around, and swing from tree to tree,<br />
Now lead a life of ignominious ease, as you can see.<br />
Have pity, O compatriot mine! and bide a season near,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>While I unfurl a dismal tale to catch your friendly ear.<br />
<br />
My pedigree is noble: they used my grandsire's skin<br />
To piece a coat for Patterson to warm himself within,&mdash;<br />
Tom Patterson, of Denver; no ermine can compare<br />
With the grizzled robe that Democratic statesman loves to wear.<br />
Of such a grandsire I am come; and in the County Cole<br />
All up an ancient cottonwood our family had its hole.<br />
We envied not the liveried pomp nor proud estate of kings,<br />
As we hustled round from day to day in search of bugs and things.<br />
<br />
And when the darkness fell around, a mocking-bird was nigh,<br />
Inviting pleasant, soothing dreams with his sweet lullaby;<br />
And sometimes came the yellow dog to brag around all night<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>That nary 'coon could wallop him in a stand-up barrel fight.<br />
We simply smiled and let him howl, for all Mizzoorians know<br />
That ary 'coon can best a dog, if the coon gets half a show;<br />
But we'd nestle close and shiver when the mellow moon had ris'n,<br />
And the hungry nigger sought our lair in hopes to make us his'n.<br />
<br />
Raised as I was, it's hardly strange I pine for those old days;<br />
I cannot get acclimated, or used to German ways.<br />
The victuals that they give me here may all be very fine<br />
For vulgar, common palates, but they will not do for mine.<br />
The 'coon that's been accustomed to stanch democratic cheer<br />
Will not put up with onion tarts and sausage steeped in beer!<br />
No; let the rest, for meat and drink, accede to slavish terms,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>But send <i>me</i> back from whence I came, and let me grub for worms!<br />
<br />
They come, these gaping Teutons do, on Sunday afternoons,<br />
And wonder what I am,&mdash;alas, there are no German 'coons!<br />
For if there were, I still might swing at home from tree to tree,<br />
The symbol of democracy, that's woolly, blithe, and free.<br />
And yet for what my captors are I would not change my lot,<br />
For <i>I</i> have tasted liberty, these others <i>they</i> have not;<br />
So, even caged, the democratic 'coon more glory feels<br />
Than the conscript German puppets with their swords about their heels.<br />
<br />
Well, give my love to Crittenden, to Clardy, and O'Neill,<br />
To Jasper Burke and Col. Jones, and tell 'em how I feel;<br />
My compliments to Cockrill, Stephens, Switzler, Francis, Vest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Bill Nelson, J. West Goodwin, Jedge Broadhead, and the rest.<br />
Bid them be steadfast in the faith, and pay no heed at all<br />
To Joe McCullagh's badinage or Chauncey Filley's gall;<br />
And urge them to retaliate for what I'm suffering here<br />
By cinching all the alien class that wants its Sunday beer.<br />

<h2>THE PARTRIDGE.</h2>

AS beats the sun from mountain crest,<br />
With "Pretty, pretty,"<br />
Cometh the partridge from her nest.<br />
The flowers threw kisses sweet to her<br />

Yet hasteneth she to mine and me,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ah, pretty, pretty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ah, dear little partridge!</span><br />

Upon the house-top breakfast I.<br />
She comes a-chirping far and wide,<br />
And swinging from the mountain-side<br />

<br />
Thy nest's inlaid with posies rare,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And pretty, pretty;</span><br />
Bloom violet, rose, and lily there;<br />
The place is full of balmy dew<br />
(The tears of flowers in love with you!);<br />
And one and all, impassioned, call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">"O pretty, pretty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">O dear little partridge!"</span><br />
<br />
Thy feathers they are soft and sleek,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So pretty, pretty!</span><br />
Long is thy neck, and small thy beak,<br />
The color of thy plumage far<br />
More bright than rainbow colors are.<br />
Sweeter than dove is she I love,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My pretty, pretty!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My dear little partridge!</span><br />
<br />
When comes the partridge from the tree,<br />

Admitting thee most blest of all,<br />

The birds come with thee at thy call;<br />
In flocks they come, and round thee play,<br />
And this is what they seem to say,&mdash;<br />

<h2>CORINTHIAN HALL.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
CORINTHIAN HALL is a tumble-down place,<br />
Which some finical folks have pronounced a disgrace;<br />
But once was a time when Corinthian Hall<br />
Excited the rapture and plaudits of all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With its carpeted stairs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And its new yellow chairs,</span><br />
And its stunning <i>ensemble</i> of citified airs.<br />
Why, the Atchison Champion said 'twas the best<br />
Of Thespian temples extant in the West.<br />
<br />
It was new, and was ours,&mdash;that was ages ago,<br />
Before opry had spoiled the legitimate show,&mdash;<br />
It was new, and was ours! We could toss back the jeers<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>Our rivals had launched at our city for years.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Corinthian Hall!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Why, it discounted all</span><br />
Other halls in the Valley, and well I recall<br />
The night of the opening; from near and afar<br />
Came the crowd to see Toodles performed by De Bar.<br />
<br />
Oh, those days they were palmy, and never again<br />
Shall earth see such genius as gladdened us then;<br />
For actors were actors, and each one knew how<br />
To whoop up his art in the sweat of his brow.<br />
He'd a tragedy air, and wore copious hair;<br />
And when he ate victuals, he ordered 'em rare.<br />
Dame Fortune ne'er feazed him,&mdash;in fact, never could<br />
When liquor was handy and walking was good.<br />
<br />
And the shows in those days! Ah, how well I recall<br />
The shows that I saw in Corinthian Hall!<br />
Maggie Mitchell and Lotty were then in their prime;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>And as for Jane Coombs, she was simply sublime;<br />
And I'm ready to swear there is none could compare<br />
With Breslau in Borgia, supported by Fair;<br />
While in passionate r&ocirc;les it was patent to us<br />
That the great John A. Stevens was <i>ne ultra plus</i>.<br />
<br />
And was there demand for the tribute of tears,<br />
We had sweet Charlotte Thompson those halcyon years,<br />
And wee Katie Putnam. The savants allow<br />
That the like of Kate Fisher ain't visible now.<br />
What artist to-day have we equal to Rae,<br />
Or to sturdy Jack Langrishe? God rest 'em, I say!<br />
And when died Buchanan, the "St. Joe Gazette"<br />
Opined that the sun of our drama had set.<br />
<br />
Corinthian Hall was devoted to song<br />
When the Barnabee concert troupe happened along,<br />
Or Ossian E. Dodge, or the Comical Brown,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>Or the Holmans with William H. Crane struck our town;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But the one special card</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That hit us all hard</span><br />
Was Caroline Richings and Peter Bernard;<br />
And the bells of the Bergers still ring in my ears;<br />
And, oh, how I laughed at Sol Russell those years!<br />
<br />
The Haverly Minstrels were boss in those days,<br />
And our critics accorded them columns of praise;<br />
They'd handsome mustaches and big cluster rings,<br />
And their shirt fronts were blazing with diamonds and things;<br />
They gave a parade, and sweet music they made<br />
Every evening in front of the house where they played.<br />
'Twixt posters and hand-bills the town was agog<br />
For Primrose and West in their great statue clog.<br />
<br />
Many years intervene, yet I'm free to maintain<br />
That I doted on Chanfrau, McWade, and Frank Frayne;<br />
Tom Stivers, the local, declared for a truth<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>That Mayo as Hamlet was better than Booth:<br />
While in r&ocirc;les that were thrillin', involving much killin',<br />
Jim Wallick loomed up our ideal of a villain;<br />
Mrs. Bowers, Alvin Joslin, Frank Aiken,&mdash;they all<br />
Earned their titles to fame in Corinthian Hall.<br />
<br />
But Time, as begrudging the glory that fell<br />
On the spot I revere and remember so well,<br />
Spent his spite on the timbers, the plaster, and paint,<br />
And breathed on them all his morbiferous taint;<br />
So the trappings of gold and the gear manifold<br />
Got gangrened with rust and rheumatic with mould,<br />
And we saw dank decay and oblivion fall,<br />
Like vapors of night, on Corinthian Hall.<br />
<br />
When the gas is ablaze in the opry at night,<br />
And the music goes floating on billows of light,<br />
Why, I often regret that I'm grown to a man,<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 4em;">Reminiscences all</span><br />
That come with the thought of Corinthian Hall,&mdash;<br />
To hear and to see what delighted me then,<br />
And to revel in raptures of boyhood again.<br />
<br />
Though Corinthian Hall is a tumble-down place,<br />
Which some finical folks have pronounced a disgrace,<br />
There is one young old boy, quite as worthy as they,<br />
Who, aweary of art as expounded to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Would surrender what gold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">He's amassed to behold</span><br />
A tithe of the wonderful doings of old,<br />
A glimpse of the glories that used to enthrall<br />
Our <i>cr&ecirc;me de la cr&ecirc;me</i> in Corinthian Hall.<br />

<h2>THE RED, RED WEST.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
I'VE travelled in heaps of countries, and studied all kinds of art,<br />
Till there isn't a critic or connoisseur who's properly deemed so smart;<br />
And I'm free to say that the grand results of my explorations show<br />
That somehow paint gets redder the farther out West I go.<br />
<br />
I've sipped the voluptuous sherbet that the Orientals serve,<br />
And I've felt the glow of red Bordeaux tingling each separate nerve;<br />
I've sampled your classic Massic under an arbor green,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>And I've reeked with song a whole night long over a brown poteen.<br />
<br />
The stalwart brew of the land o' cakes, the schnapps of the frugal Dutch,<br />
The much-praised wine of the distant Rhine, and the beer praised overmuch,<br />
The ale of dear old London, and the port of Southern climes,&mdash;<br />
All, <i>ad infin.</i>, have I taken in a hundred thousand times.<br />
<br />
Yet, as I afore-mentioned, these other charms are naught<br />
Compared with the paramount gorgeousness with which the West is fraught;<br />
For Art and Nature are just the same in the land where the porker grows,<br />
And the paint keeps getting redder the farther out West one goes.<br />
<br />
Our savants have never discovered the reason why this is so,<br />
And ninety per cent of the laymen care less than the savants know;<br />
It answers every purpose that this is manifest:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>The paint keeps getting redder the farther you go out West.<br />
<br />
Give me no home 'neath the pale pink dome of European skies,<br />
No cot for me by the salmon sea that far to the southward lies;<br />
But away out West I would build my nest on top of a carmine hill,<br />
Where I can paint, without restraint, creation redder still!<br />

<h2>THE THREE KINGS OF COLOGNE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
FROM out Cologne there came three kings<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">To worship Jesus Christ, their King.</span><br />
To Him they sought fine herbs they brought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And many a beauteous golden thing;</span><br />
They brought their gifts to Bethlehem town,<br />
And in that manger set them down.<br />
<br />
Then spake the first king, and he said:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O Child, most heavenly, bright, and fair!</span><br />
I bring this crown to Bethlehem town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Thee, and only Thee, to wear;</span><br />
So give a heavenly crown to me<br />
When I shall come at last to Thee!"<br />
<br />
The second, then. "I bring Thee here<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This royal robe, O Child!" he cried;</span><br />
"Of silk 'tis spun, and such an one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There is not in the world beside;</span><br />
So in the day of doom requite<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Me with a heavenly robe of white!"<br />
<br />
The third king gave his gift, and quoth:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Spikenard and myrrh to Thee I bring,</span><br />
And with these twain would I most fain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Anoint the body of my King;</span><br />
So may their incense sometime rise<br />
To plead for me in yonder skies!"<br />
<br />
Thus spake the three kings of Cologne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That gave their gifts, and went their way;</span><br />
And now kneel I in prayer hard by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The cradle of the Child to-day;</span><br />
Nor crown, nor robe, nor spice I bring<br />
As offering unto Christ, my King.<br />
<br />
Yet have I brought a gift the Child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May not despise, however small;</span><br />
For here I lay my heart to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it is full of love to all.</span><br />
Take Thou the poor but loyal thing,<br />
My only tribute, Christ, my King!<br />

<h2>IPSWICH.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
IN Ipswich nights are cool and fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">And the voice that comes from the yonder sea</span><br />
Sings to the quaint old mansions there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of "the time, the time that used to be;"</span><br />
And the quaint old mansions rock and groan,<br />
And they seem to say in an undertone,<br />
With half a sigh and with half a moan:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It was, but it never again will be."</span><br />
<br />
In Ipswich witches weave at night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their magic, spells with impish glee;</span><br />
They shriek and laugh in their demon flight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the old Main House to the frightened sea.</span><br />
And ghosts of eld come out to weep<br />
Over the town that is fast asleep;<br />
And they sob and they wail, as on they creep:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It was, but it never again will be."</span><br />
<br />
In Ipswich riseth Heart-Break Hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over against the calling sea;</span><br />
And through the nights so deep and chill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watcheth a maiden constantly,&mdash;</span><br />
Watcheth alone, nor seems to hear<br />
Over the roar of the waves anear<br />
The pitiful cry of a far-off year:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"It was, but it never again will be."</span><br />
<br />
In Ipswich once a witch I knew,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An artless Saxon witch was she;</span><br />
By that flaxen hair and those eyes of blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sweet was the spell she cast on me.</span><br />
Alas! but the years have wrought me ill,<br />
And the heart that is old and battered and chill<br />
Seeketh again on Heart-Break Hill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What was, but never again can be.</span><br />
<br />
Dear Anna, I would not conjure down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ghost that cometh to solace me;</span><br />
I love to think of old Ipswich town,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where somewhat better than friends were we;</span><br />
For with every thought of the dear old place<br />
Cometh again the tender grace<br />
Of a Saxon witch's pretty face,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As it was, and is, and ever shall be.</span><br />

<h2>BILL'S TENOR AND MY BASS.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
BILL was short and dapper, while I was thin and tall;<br />
I had flowin' whiskers, but Bill had none at all;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clothes would never seem to set so nice on <i>me</i> as <i>him</i>,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Folks used to laugh, and say I was too powerful slim,&mdash;</span><br />
But Bill's clothes fit him like the paper on the wall;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we were the sparkin'est beaus in all the place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Bill sung tenor and I sung bass.</span><br />
<br />
Cyrus Baker's oldest girl was member of the choir,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>Eyes as black as Kelsey's cat, and cheeks as red as fire!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She had the best sopranner voice I think I ever heard,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sung "Coronation," "Burlington," and "Chiny" like a bird;</span><br />
Never done better than with Bill a-standin' nigh 'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-holdin' of her hymn-book so she wouldn't lose the place,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Bill sung tenor and I sung bass.</span><br />
<br />
Then there was Prudence Hubbard, so cosey-like and fat,&mdash;<br />
<i>She</i> sung alto, and wore a pee-wee hat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beaued her around one winter, and, first thing I knew,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One evenin' on the portico I up and called her "Prue"!</span><br />
But, sakes alive! she didn't mind a little thing like that;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On all the works of Providence she set a cheerful face</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Bill was singin' tenor and I was singin' bass.</span><br />
<br />
Bill, nevermore we two shall share the fun we used to then,<br />
Nor know the comfort and the peace we had together when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We lived in Massachusetts in the good old courtin' days,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lifted up our voices in psalms and hymns of praise.</span><br />
Oh, how I wisht that I could live them happy times again!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For life, as we boys knew it, had a sweet, peculiar grace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When you was singin' tenor and I was singin' bass.</span><br />
<br />
The music folks have nowadays ain't what it used to be,<br />
Because there ain't no singers now on earth like Bill and me.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, Lemuel Bangs, who used to go to Springfield twice a year,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Admitted that for singin' Bill and me had not a peer</span><br />
When Bill went soarin' up to A and I dropped down to D!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The old bull-fiddle Beza Dimmitt played warn't in the race</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Longside of Bill's high tenor and my sonorious bass.</span><br />
<br />
Bill moved to Californy in the spring of '54,<br />
And we folks that used to know him never knew him any more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then Cyrus Baker's oldest girl, she kind o' pined a spell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, hankerin' after sympathy, it naterally befell</span><br />
That she married Deacon Pitkin's boy, who kep' the general store;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so the years, the changeful years, have rattled on apace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since Bill sung tenor and I sung bass.</span><br />
<br />
As I was settin' by the stove this evenin' after tea,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>I noticed wife kep' hitchin' close and closer up to me;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as she patched the gingham frock our gran'child wore to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I heerd her gin a sigh that seemed to come from fur away.</span><br />
Couldn't help inquirin' what the trouble might be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Was thinkin' of the time," says Prue, a-breshin' at her face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When Bill sung tenor and you sung bass."</span><br />

<h2>FIDUCIT.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THREE comrades on the German Rhine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Defying care and weather,</span><br />
Together quaffed the mellow wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sung their songs together.</span><br />
What recked they of the griefs of life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With wine and song to cheer them?</span><br />
Though elsewhere trouble might be rife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It would not come anear them.</span><br />
<br />
Anon one comrade passed away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And presently another,</span><br />
And yet unto the tryst each day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Repaired the lonely brother;</span><br />
And still, as gayly as of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That third one, hero-hearted,</span><br />
Filled to the brim each cup of gold,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And called to the departed,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
"O comrades mine! I see ye not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor hear your kindly greeting,</span><br />
Yet in this old, familiar spot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be still our loving meeting!</span><br />
Here have I filled each bouting-cup<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With juices red and cheery;</span><br />
I pray ye drink the portion up,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as of old make merry!"</span><br />
<br />
And once before his tear-dimmed eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All in the haunted gloaming,</span><br />
He saw two ghostly figures rise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quaff the beakers foaming;</span><br />
He heard two spirit voices call,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Fiducit, jovial brother!"</span><br />
And so forever from that hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went they with one another.</span><br />

<h2>THE "ST. JO GAZETTE."</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette,"<br />
I was upon familiar terms with every one I met;<br />
For "items" were my stock in trade in that my callow time,<br />
Before the muses tempted me to try my hand at rhyme,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Before I found in verses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Those soothing, gracious mercies,</span><br />
Less practical, but much more glorious than a well-filled purse is.<br />
A votary of Mammon, I hustled round and sweat,<br />
And helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
The labors of the day began at half-past eight <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>For the farmers came in early, and I had to tackle them;<br />
And many a noble bit of news I managed to acquire<br />
By those discreet attentions which all farmer-folk admire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With my daily commentary</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On affairs of farm and dairy,</span><br />
The tone of which anon with subtle pufferies I'd vary,&mdash;<br />
Oh, many a peck of apples and of peaches did I get<br />
When I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
Dramatic news was scarce, but when a minstrel show was due,<br />
Why, Milton Tootle's opera house was then my rendezvous;<br />
Judge Grubb would give me points about the latest legal case,<br />
And Dr. Runcie let me print his sermons when I'd space;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of fevers, fractures, humors,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Contusions, fits, and tumors,</span><br />
Would Dr. Hall or Dr. Baines confirm or nail the rumors;<br />
From Colonel Dawes what railroad news there was I used to get,&mdash;<br />
When I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
For "personals" the old Pacific House was just the place,&mdash;<br />
Pap Abell knew the pedigrees of all the human race;<br />
And when he'd gin up all he had, he'd drop a subtle wink,<br />
And lead the way where one might wet one's whistle with a drink.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Those drinks at the Pacific,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When days were sudorific,</span><br />
Were what Parisians (pray excuse my French!) would call "magnifique;"<br />
And frequently an invitation to a meal I'd get<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>When I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
And when in rainy weather news was scarce as well as slow,<br />
To Saxton's bank or Hopkins' store for items would I go.<br />
The jokes which Colonel Saxton told were old, but good enough<br />
For local application in lieu of better stuff;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And when the ducks were flying,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Or the fishing well worth trying&mdash;</span><br />
Gosh! but those "sports" at Hopkins' store could beat the world at lying!<br />
And I&mdash;I printed all their yarns, though not without regret,<br />
When I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
For squibs political I'd go to Col. Waller Young,<br />
Or Col. James N. Burnes, the "statesman with the silver tongue;"<br />
Should some old pioneer take sick and die, why, then I'd call<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>On Frank M. Posegate for the "life," and Posegate knew 'em all.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Lon Tullar used to pony</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Up descriptions that were tony</span><br />
Of toilets worn at party, ball, or conversazione;<br />
For the ladies were addicted to the style called "deckolett"<br />
When I helped 'em run the local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
So was I wont my daily round of labor to pursue;<br />
And when came night I found that there was still more work to do,&mdash;<br />
The telegraph to edit, yards and yards of proof to read,<br />
And reprint to be gathered to supply the printers' greed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh, but it takes agility,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Combined with versatility,</span><br />
To run a country daily with appropriate ability!<br />
There never were a smarter lot of editors, I'll bet,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>Than we who whooped up local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />
<br />
Yes, maybe it was irksome; maybe a discontent<br />
Rebellious rose amid the toil I daily underwent<br />
If so, I don't remember; this only do I know,&mdash;<br />
My thoughts turn ever fondly to that time in old St. Jo.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The years that speed so fleetly</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Have blotted out completely</span><br />
All else than that which still remains to solace me so sweetly;<br />
The friendships of that time,&mdash;ah, me! they are as precious yet<br />
As when I was a local on the "St. Jo Gazette."<br />

<h2>IN AMSTERDAM.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
MEYNHEER Hans Von Der Bloom has got<br />
A majazin in Kalverstraat,<br />
Where one may buy for sordid gold<br />
Wares quaint and curious, new and old.<br />
Here are antiquities galore,&mdash;<br />
The jewels which Dutch monarchs wore,<br />
Swords, teacups, helmets, platters, clocks,<br />
Bright Dresden jars, dull Holland crocks,<br />
And all those joys I might rehearse<br />
That please the eye, but wreck the purse.<br />
<br />
I most admired an ancient bed,<br />
With ornate carvings at its head,&mdash;<br />
A massive frame of dingy oak,<br />
Whose curious size and mould bespoke<br />
Prodigious age. "How much?" I cried.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>"Ein tousand gildens," Hans replied;<br />
And then the honest Dutchman said<br />
A king once owned that glorious bed,&mdash;<br />
King Fritz der Foorst, of blessed fame,<br />
Had owned and slept within the same!<br />
<br />
Then long I stood and mutely gazed,<br />
By reminiscent splendors dazed,<br />
And I had bought it right away,<br />
Had I the wherewithal to pay.<br />
But, lacking of the needed pelf,<br />
I thus discoursed within myself:<br />
"O happy Holland! where's the bliss<br />
That can approximate to this<br />
Possession of the rare antique<br />
Which maniacs hanker for and seek?<br />
<i>My</i> native land is full of stuff<br />
That's good, but is not old enough.<br />
Alas! it has no oaken beds<br />
Wherein have slumbered royal heads,<br />
No relic on whose face we see<br />
The proof of grand antiquity."<br />
<br />
Thus reasoned I a goodly spell<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>Until, perchance, my vision fell<br />
Upon a trademark at the head<br />
Of Fritz der Foorst's old oaken bed,&mdash;<br />
A rampant wolverine, and round<br />
This strange device these words I found:<br />
"Patent Antique. Birkey &amp; Gay,<br />
Grand Rapids, Michigan, U. S. A."<br />
<br />
At present I'm not saying much<br />
About the simple, guileless Dutch;<br />
And as it were a loathsome spot<br />
I keep away from Kalverstraat,<br />
Determined when I want a bed<br />
In which hath slept a royal head<br />
I'll patronize no middleman,<br />
But deal direct with Michigan.<br />

<h2>TO THE PASSING SAINT.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
AS to-night you came your way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bearing earthward heavenly joy,</span><br />
Tell me, O dear saint, I pray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did you see my little boy?</span><br />
<br />
By some fairer voice beguiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once he wandered from my sight;</span><br />
He is such a little child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He should have my love this night.</span><br />
<br />
It has been so many a year,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, so many a year since then!</span><br />
Yet he was so very dear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Surely he will come again.</span><br />
<br />
If upon your way you see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One whose beauty is divine,</span><br />
Will you send him back to me?<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is lost, and he is mine.</span><br />
<br />
Tell him that his little chair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nestles where the sunbeams meet,</span><br />
That the shoes he used to wear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yearn to kiss his dimpled feet.</span><br />
<br />
Tell him of each pretty toy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That was wont to share his glee;</span><br />
Maybe that will bring my boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back to them and back to me.</span><br />
<br />
O dear saint, as on you go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through the glad and sparkling frost,</span><br />

<h2>THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
OF all the gracious gifts of Spring,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is there another can surpass</span><br />
This delicate, voluptuous thing,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This dapple-green, plump-shouldered bass?</span><br />
Upon a damask napkin laid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What exhalations superfine</span><br />
Our gustatory nerves pervade,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Provoking quenchless thirsts for wine!</span><br />
<br />
The ancients loved this noble fish;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, coming from the kitchen fire</span><br />
All piping hot upon a dish,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What raptures did he not inspire?</span><br />
"Fish should swim twice," they used to say,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once in their native, vapid brine,</span><br />
And then again, a better way&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You understand; fetch on the wine!</span><br />
<br />
Ah, dainty monarch of the flood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How often have I cast for you,</span><br />
How often sadly seen you scud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where weeds and water-lilies grew!</span><br />
How often have you filched my bait,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How often snapped my treacherous line!</span><br />
Yet here I have you on this plate,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You <i>shall</i> swim twice, and <i>now</i> in <i>wine</i>.</span><br />
<br />
And, harkee, gar&ccedil;on! let the blood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cobwebbed years be spilled for him,&mdash;</span><br />
Ay, in a rich Burgundian flood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This piscatorial pride should swim;</span><br />
So, were he living, he would say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He gladly died for me and mine,</span><br />
And, as it were his native spray,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He'd lash the sauce&mdash;what, ho! the wine!</span><br />
<br />
I would it were ordained for me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To share your fate, O finny friend!</span><br />
I surely were not loath to be<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reserved for such a noble end;</span><br />
For when old Chronos, gaunt and grim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At last reels in his ruthless line,</span><br />
What were my ecstasy to swim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In wine, in wine, in glorious wine!</span><br />
<br />
Well, here's a health to you, sweet Spring!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, prithee, whilst I stick to earth,</span><br />
Come hither every year and bring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The boons provocative of mirth;</span><br />
And should your stock of bass run low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">However much I might repine,</span><br />
I think I might survive the blow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If plied with wine and still more wine!</span><br />

<h2>NIGHTFALL IN DORDRECHT.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THE mill goes toiling slowly around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With steady and solemn creak,</span><br />
And my little one hears in the kindly sound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The voice of the old mill speak;</span><br />
While round and round those big white wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grimly and ghostlike creep,</span><br />
My little one hears that the old mill sings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sleep, little tulip, sleep!"</span><br />
<br />
The sails are reefed and the nets are drawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And over his pot of beer</span><br />
The fisher, against the morrow's dawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lustily maketh cheer;</span><br />
He mocks at the winds that caper along<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the far-off, clamorous deep,</span><br />
But we&mdash;we love their lullaby-song<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of "Sleep, little tulip, sleep!"</span><br />
<br />
Old dog Fritz, in slumber sound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Groans of the stony mart;</span><br />
To-morrow how proudly he'll trot you around,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hitched to our new milk-cart!</span><br />
And you shall help me blanket the kine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fold the gentle sheep,</span><br />
And set the herring a-soak in brine,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now, little tulip, sleep!</span><br />
<br />
A Dream-One comes to button the eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wearily droop and blink,</span><br />
While the old mill buffets the frowning skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And scolds at the stars that wink;</span><br />
Over your face the misty wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that beautiful Dream-One sweep,</span><br />
And, rocking your cradle, she softly sings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sleep, little tulip, sleep!"</span><br />

<h2>THE ONION TART.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
OF tarts there be a thousand kinds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So versatile the art,</span><br />
And, as we all have different minds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each has his favorite tart;</span><br />
But those which most delight the rest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Methinks should suit me not:</span><br />
The onion tart doth please me best,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
Where but in Deutschland can be found<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This boon of which I sing?</span><br />
Who but a Teuton could compound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This <i>sui generis</i> thing?</span><br />
None with the German frau can vie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In arts cuisine, I wot,</span><br />
Whose <i>summum bonum</i> breeds the sigh,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!"</span><br />
<br />
You slice the fruit upon the dough,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And season to the taste,</span><br />
Then in an oven (not too slow)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The viand should be placed;</span><br />
And when 'tis done, upon a plate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You serve it piping hot.</span><br />
Your nostrils and your eyes dilate,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
It sweeps upon the sight and smell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In overwhelming tide,</span><br />
And then the sense of taste as well<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Betimes is gratified:</span><br />
Three noble senses drowned in bliss!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I prithee tell me, what</span><br />
Is there beside compares with this?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
For if the fruit be proper young,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And if the crust be good,</span><br />
How shall they melt upon the tongue<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into a savory flood!</span><br />
How seek the Mecca down below,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And linger round that spot,</span><br />
Entailing weeks and months of woe,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
If Nature gives men appetites<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For things that won't digest,</span><br />
Why, let <i>them</i> eat whatso delights,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And let <i>her</i> stand the rest;</span><br />
And though the sin involve the cost<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Carlsbad, like as not</span><br />
'Tis better to have loved and lost,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
Beyond the vast, the billowy tide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where my compatriots dwell,</span><br />
All kinds of victuals have I tried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All kinds of drinks, as well;</span><br />
But nothing known to Yankee art<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Appears to reach <i>the spot</i></span><br />
Like this Teutonic onion tart,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />
<br />
So, though I quaff of Carlsbad's tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As full as I can hold,</span><br />
And for complete reform inside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plank down my horde of gold,</span><br />
Remorse shall not consume my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor sorrow vex my lot,</span><br />
For I have eaten onion tart,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ach, Gott! mein lieber Gott!</span><br />

<h2>GRANDMA'S BOMBAZINE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
IT'S everywhere that women fair invite and please my eye,<br />
And that on dress I lay much stress I can't and sha'n't deny:<br />
The English dame who's all aflame with divers colors bright,<br />
The Teuton belle, the ma'moiselle,&mdash;all give me keen delight;<br />
And yet I'll say, go where I may, I never yet have seen<br />
A dress that's quite as grand a sight as was that bombazine.<br />
<br />
Now, you must know 'twas years ago this quaint but noble gown<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>Flashed in one day, the usual way, upon our solemn town.<br />
'Twas Fisk who sold for sordid gold that gravely scrumptious thing,&mdash;<br />
Jim Fisk, the man who drove a span that would have joyed a king,&mdash;<br />
And grandma's eye fell with a sigh upon that sombre sheen,<br />
And grandpa's purse looked much the worse for grandma's bombazine.<br />
<br />
Though ten years old, I never told the neighbors of the gown;<br />
For grandma said, "This secret, Ned, must not be breathed in town."<br />
The sitting-room for days of gloom was in a dreadful mess<br />
When that quaint dame, Miss Kelsey, came to make the wondrous dress:<br />
To fit and baste and stitch a waist, with whale-bones in between,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>Is precious slow, as all folks know who've made a bombazine.<br />
<br />
With fortitude dear grandma stood the trial to the end<br />
(The nerve we find in womankind I cannot comprehend!);<br />
And when 'twas done resolved that none should guess at the surprise,<br />
Within the press she hid that dress, secure from prying eyes;<br />
For grandma knew a thing or two,&mdash;by which remark I mean<br />
That Sundays were the days for her to wear that bombazine.<br />
<br />
I need not state she got there late; and, sailing up the aisle<br />
With regal grace, on grandma's face reposed a conscious smile.<br />
It fitted so, above, below, and hung so well all round,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>That there was not one faulty spot a critic could have found.<br />
How proud I was of her, because she looked so like a queen!<br />
And that was why, perhaps, that I admired the bombazine.<br />
<br />
But there <i>were</i> those, as you'd suppose, who scorned that perfect gown;<br />
For ugly-grained old cats obtained in that New England town:<br />
The Widow White spat out her spite in one: "It doesn't fit!"<br />
The Packard girls (they wore false curls) all giggled like to split;<br />
Sophronia Wade, the sour old maid, <i>she</i> turned a bilious green,<br />
When she descried that joy and pride, my grandma's bombazine.<br />
<br />
But grandma knew, and I did, too, that gown was wondrous fine,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>The envious sneers and jaundiced jeers were a conclusive sign.<br />
Why, grandpa said it went ahead of all the girls in town,<br />
And, saying this, he snatched a kiss that like to burst that gown;<br />
But, blushing red, my grandma said, "Oh, isn't grandpa mean!"<br />
Yet evermore my grandma wore <i>his</i> favorite bombazine.<br />
<br />
And when she died that sombre pride passed down to heedless heirs,&mdash;<br />
Alas, the day 't was hung away beneath the kitchen stairs!<br />
Thence in due time, with dust and grime, came foes on foot and wing,<br />
And made their nests and sped their guests in that once beauteous thing.<br />
'Tis so, forsooth! Time's envious tooth corrodes each human scene;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>And so, at last, to ruin passed my grandma's bombazine.<br />
<br />
Yet to this day, I'm proud to say, it plays a grateful part,&mdash;<br />
The thoughts it brings are of such things as touch and warm my heart.<br />
This gown, my dear, you show me here I'll own is passing fair,<br />
Though I'll confess it's no such dress as grandma used to wear.<br />
Yet wear it, <i>do</i>; perchance when you and I are off the scene,<br />
Our boy shall sing <i>this</i> comely thing as <i>I</i> the bombazine.<br />

<h2>RARE ROAST BEEF.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN the numerous distempers to which all flesh is heir<br />
Torment us till our very souls are reeking with despair;<br />
When that monster fiend, Dyspepsy, rears its spectral hydra head,<br />
Filling <i>bon vivants</i> and epicures with certain nameless dread;<br />
When <i>any</i> ill of body or of intellect abounds,<br />
Be it sickness known to Galen or disease unknown to Lowndes,&mdash;<br />
In such a dire emergency it is my firm belief<br />
That there is no diet quite so good as rare roast beef.<br />
<br />
And even when the body's in the very prime of health,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>When sweet contentment spreads upon the cheeks her rosy wealth,<br />
And when a man devours three meals per day and pines for more,<br />
And growls because instead of three square meals there are not four,&mdash;<br />
Well, even then, though cake and pie do service on the side,<br />
And coffee is a luxury that may not be denied,<br />
Still of the many viands there is one that's hailed as chief,<br />
And that, as you are well aware, is rare roast beef.<br />
<br />
Some like the sirloin, but I think the porterhouse is best,&mdash;<br />
'Tis juicier and tenderer and meatier than the rest;<br />
Put on this roast a dash of salt, and then of water pour<br />
Into the sizzling dripping-pan a cupful, and no more;<br />
The oven being hot, the roast will cook in half an hour;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>Then to the juices in the pan you add a little flour,<br />
And so you get a gravy that is called the cap sheaf<br />
Of that glorious <i>summum bonum</i>, rare roast beef.<br />
<br />
Served on a platter that is hot, and carved with thin, keen knife,<br />
How does this savory viand enhance the worth of life!<br />
Give me no thin and shadowy slice, but a thick and steaming slab,&mdash;<br />
Who would not choose a generous hunk to a bloodless little dab?<br />
Upon a nice hot plate how does the juicy morceau steam,<br />
A symphony in scarlet or a red incarnate dream!<br />
Take from me eyes and ears and all, O Time, thou ruthless thief!<br />
Except these teeth wherewith to deal with rare roast beef.<br />
<br />
Most every kind and r&ocirc;le of modern victuals have I tried,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>Including roasted, fricasseed, broiled, toasted, stewed, and fried,<br />
Your canvasbacks and papa-bottes and muttonchops subese,<br />
Your patties <i>&agrave; la</i> Turkey and your doughnuts <i>&agrave; la</i> grease;<br />
I've whirled away dyspeptic hours with crabs in marble halls,<br />
And in the lowly cottage I've experienced codfish balls;<br />
But I've never found a viand that could so allay all grief<br />
And soothe the cockles of the heart as rare roast beef.<br />
<br />
I honor that sagacious king who, in a grateful mood,<br />
Knighted the savory loin that on the royal table stood;<br />
And as for me I'd ask no better friend than this good roast,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>Which is my squeamish stomach's fortress (<i>feste Burg</i>) and host;<br />
For with this ally with me I can mock Dyspepsy's wrath,<br />
Can I pursue the joy of Wisdom's pleasant, peaceful path.<br />
So I do off my vest and let my waistband out a reef<br />
When I soever set me down to rare roast beef.<br />

<h2>GANDERFEATHER'S GIFT.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
I WAS just a little thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When a fairy came and kissed me;</span><br />
Floating in upon the light<br />
Of a haunted summer night,<br />
Lo! the fairies came to sing<br />
Pretty slumber songs, and bring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Certain boons that else had missed me.</span><br />
From a dream I turned to see<br />
What those strangers brought for me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When that fairy up and kissed me,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here, upon this cheek, he kissed me!</span><br />
<br />
Simmerdew was there, but she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did not like me altogether;</span><br />
Daisybright and Turtledove,<br />
Pilfercurds and Honeylove,<br />
Thistleblow and Amberglee<br />
On that gleaming, ghostly sea<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Floated from the misty heather,</span><br />
And around my trundle-bed<br />
Frisked and looked and whispering said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Solemn-like and all together:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"<i>You</i> shall kiss him, Ganderfeather!"</span><br />
<br />
Ganderfeather kissed me then,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ganderfeather, quaint and merry!</span><br />
No attenuate sprite was he,<br />
But as buxom as could be;<br />
Kissed me twice and once again,<br />
And the others shouted when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On my cheek uprose a berry</span><br />
Somewhat like a mole, mayhap,<br />
But the kiss-mark of that chap<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ganderfeather, passing merry,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Humorsome but kindly, very!</span><br />
<br />
I was just a tiny thing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the prankish Ganderfeather</span><br />
Brought this curious gift to me<br />
With his fairy kisses three;<br />
Yet with honest pride I sing<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>That same gift he chose to bring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of yonder haunted heather;</span><br />
Other charms and friendships fly,&mdash;<br />
Constant friends this mole and I,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who have been so long together!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thank you, little Ganderfeather!</span><br />

<h2>OLD TIMES, OLD FRIENDS, OLD LOVE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THERE are no days like the good old days,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The days when we were youthful!</span><br />
When humankind were pure of mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And speech and deeds were truthful;</span><br />
Before a love for sordid gold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Became man's ruling passion,</span><br />
And before each dame and maid became<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slave to the tyrant fashion!</span><br />
<br />
There are no girls like the good old girls,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the world I'd stake 'em!</span><br />
As buxom and smart and clean of heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the Lord knew how to make 'em!</span><br />
They were rich in spirit and common-sense,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And piety all supportin';</span><br />
They could bake and brew, and had taught school, too,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they made such likely courtin'!</span><br />
<br />
There are no boys like the good old boys,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When <i>we</i> were boys together!</span><br />
When the grass was sweet to the brown bare feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dimpled the laughing heather;</span><br />
When the pewee sung to the summer dawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the bee in the billowy clover,</span><br />
Or down by the mill the whip-poor-will<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Echoed his night song over.</span><br />
<br />
There is no love like the good old love,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love that mother gave us!</span><br />
We are old, old men, yet we pine again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that precious grace,&mdash;God save us!</span><br />
So we dream and dream of the good old times,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our hearts grow tenderer, fonder,</span><br />
As those dear old dreams bring soothing gleams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of heaven away off yonder.</span><br />

<h2>OUR WHIPPINGS.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
COME, Harvey, let us sit awhile and talk about the times<br />
Before you went to selling clothes and I to peddling rhymes,&mdash;<br />
The days when we were little boys, as naughty little boys<br />
As ever worried home folks with their everlasting noise!<br />
Egad! and were we so disposed, I'll venture we could show<br />
The scars of wallopings we got some forty years ago;<br />
What wallopings I mean I think I need not specify,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Mother's whippings didn't hurt; but father's,&mdash;oh, my!<br />
<br />
The way that we played hookey those many years ago,<br />
We'd rather give 'most anything than have our children know!<br />
The thousand naughty things we did, the thousand fibs we told,&mdash;<br />
Why, thinking of them makes my Presbyterian blood run cold!<br />
How often Deacon Sabine Morse remarked if we were his<br />
He'd tan our "pesky little hides until the blisters riz"!<br />
It's many a hearty thrashing to that Deacon Morse we owe,&mdash;<br />
Mother's whippings didn't count; father's did, though!<br />
<br />
We used to sneak off swimmin' in those careless, boyish days,<br />
And come back home of evenings with our necks and backs ablaze;<br />
How mother used to wonder why our clothes were full of sand,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>But father, having been a boy, appeared to understand;<br />
And after tea he'd beckon us to join him in the shed,<br />
Where he'd proceed to tinge our backs a deeper, darker red.<br />
Say what we will of mother's, there is none will controvert<br />
The proposition that our father's lickings always hurt!<br />
<br />
For mother was by nature so forgiving and so mild<br />
That she inclined to spare the rod although she spoiled the child;<br />
And when at last in self-defence she had to whip us, she<br />
Appeared to feel those whippings a great deal more than we:<br />
But how we bellowed and took on, as if we'd like to die,&mdash;<br />
Poor mother really thought she hurt, and that's what made <i>her</i> cry!<br />
Then how we youngsters snickered as out the door we slid,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>For mother's whippings never hurt, though father's always did!<br />
<br />
In after years poor father simmered down to five feet four,<br />
But in our youth he seemed to us in height eight feet or more!<br />
Oh, how we shivered when he quoth in cold, suggestive tone:<br />
"I'll see you in the woodshed after supper all alone!"<br />
Oh, how the legs and arms and dust and trouser-buttons flew,&mdash;<br />
What florid vocalisms marked that vesper interview!<br />
Yes, after all this lapse of years, I feelingly assert,<br />
With all respect to mother, it was father's whippings hurt!<br />
<br />
The little boy experiencing that tingling 'neath his vest<br />
Is often loath to realize that all is for the best;<br />
Yet, when the boy gets older, he pictures with delight<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>The bufferings of childhood,&mdash;as we do here to-night.<br />
The years, the gracious years, have smoothed and beautified the ways<br />
That to our little feet seemed all too rugged in the days<br />
Before you went to selling clothes and I to peddling rhymes,&mdash;<br />
So, Harvey, let us sit awhile and think upon those times.<br />

<h2>BION'S SONG OF EROS.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
EROS is the god of love;<br />
He and I are hand-in-glove.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All the gentle, gracious Muses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Follow Eros where he leads,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they bless the bard who chooses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To proclaim love's famous deeds;</span><br />
Him they serve in rapturous glee,&mdash;<br />
That is why they're good to me.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I have gone astray<br />
From love's sunny, flowery way:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How I floundered, how I stuttered!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And, deprived of ways and means,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What egregious rot I uttered,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such as suits the magazines!</span><br />
I was rescued only when<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>Eros called me back again.<br />
<br />
Gods forefend that I should shun<br />
That benignant Mother's son!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, the poet who refuses</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To emblazon love's delights</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gets the mitten from the Muses,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then what balderdash he writes!</span><br />
I love Love; which being so,<br />
See how smooth my verses flow!<br />
<br />
Gentle Eros, lead the way,&mdash;<br />
I will follow while I may:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be thy path by hill or hollow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will follow fast and free;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when I'm too old to follow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I will sit and sing of thee,&mdash;</span><br />
Potent still in intellect,<br />
Sit, and sing, and retrospect.<br />

<h2>MR. BILLINGS OF LOUISVILLE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
THERE are times in one's life which one cannot forget;<br />
And the time I remember's the evening I met<br />
A haughty young scion of bluegrass renown<br />
Who made my acquaintance while painting the town:<br />
A handshake, a cocktail, a smoker, and then<br />
Mr. Billings of Louisville touched me for ten.<br />
<br />
There flowed in his veins the blue blood of the South,<br />
And a cynical smile curled his sensuous mouth;<br />
He quoted from Lanier and Poe by the yard,<br />
But his purse had been hit by the war, and hit hard:<br />
I felt that he honored and flattered me when<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>Mr. Billings of Louisville touched me for ten.<br />
<br />
I wonder that never again since that night<br />
A vision of Billings has hallowed my sight;<br />
I pine for the sound of his voice and the thrill<br />
That comes with the touch of a ten-dollar bill:<br />
I wonder and pine; for&mdash;I say it again&mdash;<br />
Mr. Billings of Louisville touched me for ten.<br />
<br />
I've heard what old Whittier sung of Miss Maud;<br />
But all such philosophy's nothing but fraud;<br />
To one who's a bear in Chicago to-day,<br />
With wheat going up, and the devil to pay,<br />
These words are the saddest of tongue or of pen:<br />
"Mr. Billings of Louisville touched me for ten."<br />

<h2>POET AND KING.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
THOUGH I am king, I have no throne<br />
Save this rough wooden siege alone;<br />
I have no empire, yet my sway<br />
Extends a myriad leagues away;<br />
No servile vassal bends his knee<br />
In grovelling reverence to me,<br />
Yet at my word all hearts beat high,<br />
And there is fire in every eye,<br />
And love and gratitude they bring<br />
As tribute unto me, a king.<br />
<br />
The folk that throng the busy street<br />
Know not it is a king they meet;<br />
And I am glad there is not seen<br />
The monarch in my face and mien.<br />
I should not choose to be the cause<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>Of fawning or of coarse applause:<br />
I am content to know the arts<br />
Wherewith to lord it o'er their hearts;<br />
For when unto their hearts I sing,<br />
I am a king, I am a king!<br />
<br />
My sceptre,&mdash;see, it is a pen!<br />
Wherewith I rule these hearts of men.<br />
Sometime it pleaseth to beguile<br />
Its monarch fancy with a smile;<br />
Sometime it is athirst for tears:<br />
And so adown the laurelled years<br />
I walk, the noblest lord on earth,<br />
Dispensing sympathy and mirth.<br />
Aha! it is a magic thing<br />
That makes me what I am,&mdash;a king!<br />
<br />
Let empires crumble as they may,<br />
Proudly I hold imperial sway;<br />
The sunshine and the rain of years<br />
Are human smiles and human tears<br />
That come or vanish at my call,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>I am the monarch of them all!<br />
Mindful alone of this am I:<br />
The songs I sing shall never die;<br />
Not even envious Death can wring<br />
His glory from so great a king.<br />
<br />
Come, brother, be a king with me,<br />
And rule mankind eternally;<br />
Lift up the weak, and cheer the strong,<br />
Defend the truth, combat the wrong!<br />
You'll find no sceptre like the pen<br />
To hold and sway the hearts of men;<br />
Its edicts flow in blood and tears<br />
That will outwash the flood of years:<br />
So, brother, sing your songs, oh, sing!<br />
And be with me a king, a king!<br />

<h2>LYDIA DICK.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WHEN I was a boy at college,<br />
Filling up with classic knowledge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frequently I wondered why</span><br />
Old Professor Demas Bentley<br />
Used to praise so eloquently<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Opera Horatii."</span><br />
<br />
Toiling on a season longer<br />
Till my reasoning powers got stronger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As my observation grew,</span><br />
I became convinced that mellow,<br />
Massic-loving poet fellow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Horace, knew a thing or two.</span><br />
<br />
Yes, we sophomores figured duly<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>That, if we appraised him truly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Horace must have been a brick;</span><br />
And no wonder that with ranting<br />
Rhymes he went a-gallivanting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round with sprightly Lydia Dick!</span><br />
<br />
For that pink of female gender<br />
Tall and shapely was, and slender,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plump of neck and bust and arms;</span><br />
While the raiment that invested<br />
Her so jealously suggested<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Certain more potential charms.</span><br />
<br />
Those dark eyes of hers that fired him,<br />
Those sweet accents that inspired him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her crown of glorious hair,&mdash;</span><br />
These things baffle my description:<br />
I should have a fit conniption<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If I tried; so I forbear.</span><br />
<br />
Maybe Lydia had her betters;<br />
Anyway, this man of letters<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took that charmer as his pick.</span><br />
Glad&mdash;yes, glad I am to know it!<br />
I, a <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> poet,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sympathize with Lydia Dick!</span><br />
<br />
Often in my arbor shady<br />
I fall thinking of that lady,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pranks she used to play;</span><br />
And I'm cheered,&mdash;for all we sages<br />
Joy when from those distant ages<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lydia dances down our way.</span><br />
<br />
Otherwise some folks might wonder,<br />
With good reason, why in thunder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Learned professors, dry and prim,</span><br />
Find such solace in the giddy<br />
Pranks that Horace played with Liddy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or that Liddy played on him.</span><br />
<br />
Still this world of ours rejoices<br />
In those ancient singing voices,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our hearts beat high and quick,</span><br />
To the cadence of old Tiber<br />
Murmuring praise of roistering Liber<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of charming Lydia Dick.</span><br />
<br />
Still Digentia, downward flowing,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>Prattleth to the roses blowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the dark, deserted grot.</span><br />
Still Soracte, looming lonely,<br />
Watcheth for the coming only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a ghost that cometh not.</span><br />

<h2>LITTLE HOMER'S SLATE.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
AFTER dear old grandma died,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hunting through an oaken chest</span><br />
In the attic, we espied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What repaid our childish quest:</span><br />
'Twas a homely little slate,<br />
Seemingly of ancient date.<br />
<br />
On its quaint and battered face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the picture of a cart</span><br />
Drawn with all that awkward grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which betokens childish art.</span><br />
But what meant this legend, pray:<br />
"Homer drew this yesterday"?<br />
<br />
Mother recollected then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What the years were fain to hide:</span><br />
She was but a baby when<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little Homer lived and died.</span><br />
Forty years, so mother said,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Little Homer had been dead.<br />
<br />
This one secret through those years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grandma kept from all apart,</span><br />
Hallowed by her lonely tears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the breaking of her heart;</span><br />
While each year that sped away<br />
Seemed to her but yesterday.<br />
<br />
So the homely little slate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grandma's baby's fingers pressed,</span><br />
To a memory consecrate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lieth in the oaken chest,</span><br />
Where, unwilling we should know,<br />
Grandma put it years ago.<br />

<h2>PROVIDENCE AND THE DOG.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
WHEN I was young and callow, which was many years ago,<br />
Within me the afflatus went surging to and fro;<br />
And so I wrote a tragedy that fairly reeked with gore,<br />
With every act concluding with the dead piled on the floor,&mdash;<br />
A mighty effort, by the gods! and after I had read<br />
The manuscript to Daly, that dramatic censor said:<br />
"The plot is most exciting, and I like the dialogue;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>You should take the thing to Providence, and try it on a dog."<br />
<br />
McCambridge organized a troupe, including many a name<br />
Unknown alike to guileless me, to riches, and to fame.<br />
A pompous man whose name was Rae was Nestor of this troupe,&mdash;<br />
Amphibious, he was quite at home outside or in the soup!<br />
The way McCambridge billed him! Why, such dreams in red and green<br />
Had ne'er before upon the boards of Yankeedom been seen;<br />
And my proud name was heralded,&mdash;oh that I'd gone incog.<br />
When we took that play to Providence to try it on a dog!<br />
<br />
Shall I forget the awful day we struck that wretched town?<br />
Yet in what melting irony the treacherous sun beamed down!<br />
The sale of seats had not been large; but then McCambridge said<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>The factory people seldom bought their seats so far ahead,<br />
And Rae indorsed McCambridge. So they partly set at rest<br />
The natural misgivings that perturbed my youthful breast;<br />
For I wondered and lamented that the town was not agog<br />
When I took my play to Providence to try it on a dog.<br />
<br />
They never came at all,&mdash;aha! I knew it all the time,&mdash;<br />
They never came to see and hear my tragedy sublime.<br />
Oh, fateful moment when the curtain rose on act the first!<br />
Oh, moment fateful to the soul for wealth and fame athirst!<br />
But lucky factory girls and boys to stay away that night,<br />
When the author's fervid soul was touched by disappointment's blight,&mdash;<br />
When desolation settled down on me like some dense fog<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>For having tempted Providence, and tried it on a dog!<br />
<br />
Those actors didn't know their parts; they maundered to and fro,<br />
Ejaculating platitudes that were quite <i>mal &agrave; propos</i>;<br />
And when I sought to reprimand the graceless scamps, the lot<br />
Turned fiercely on me, and denounced my charming play as rot.<br />
I might have stood their bitter taunts without a passing grunt,<br />
If I'd had a word of solace from the people out in front;<br />
But that chilly corporal's guard sat round like bumps upon a log<br />
When I played that play at Providence with designs upon the dog.<br />
<br />
We went with lots of baggage, but we didn't bring it back,&mdash;<br />
For who would be so hampered as he walks a railway track?<br />
"Oh, ruthless muse of tragedy! what prodigies of shame,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>What marvels of injustice are committed in thy name!"<br />
Thus groaned I in the spirit, as I strode what stretch of ties<br />
'Twixt Providence, Rhode Island, and my native Gotham lies;<br />
But Rae, McCambridge, and the rest kept up a steady jog,&mdash;<br />
'Twas not the first time they had plied their arts upon the dog.<br />
<br />
So much for my first battle with the fickle goddess, Fame,&mdash;<br />
And I hear that some folks nowadays are faring just the same.<br />
Oh, hapless he that on the graceless Yankee dog relies!<br />
The dog fares stout and hearty, and the play it is that dies.<br />
So ye with tragedies to try, I beg of you, beware!<br />
Put not your trust in Providence, that most delusive snare;<br />
Cast, if you will, your pearls of thought before the Western hog,<br />
But never go to Providence to try it on a dog.<br />

<h2>GETTIN' ON.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
WHEN I wuz somewhat younger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wuz reckoned purty gay;</span><br />
I had my fling at everything<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a rollickin', coltish way.</span><br />
But times have strangely altered<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since sixty years ago&mdash;</span><br />
This age of steam an' things don't seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the age I used to know.</span><br />
Your modern innovations<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Don't suit me, I confess,</span><br />
As did the ways of the good ol' days,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I'm gettin' on, I guess.</span><br />
<br />
I set on the piazza,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' hitch round with the sun;</span><br />
Sometimes, mayhap, I take a nap,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waitin' till school is done.</span><br />
An' then I tell the children<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The things I done in youth,&mdash;</span><br />
An' near as I can, as a vener'ble man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I stick to the honest truth,&mdash;</span><br />
But the looks of them 'at listen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seem sometimes to express</span><br />
The remote idee that I'm gone&mdash;you see?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An' I <i>am</i> gettin' on, I guess.</span><br />
<br />
I get up in the mornin',<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An', nothin' else to do,</span><br />
Before the rest are up an' dressed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I read the papers through.</span><br />
I hang round with the women<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All day an' hear 'em talk;</span><br />
An' while they sew or knit I show<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The baby how to walk.</span><br />
An', somehow, I feel sorry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When they put away his dress</span><br />
An' cut his curls ('cause they're like a girl's!)&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm gettin' on, I guess.</span><br />
<br />
Sometimes, with twilight round me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see, or seem to see,</span><br />
A distant shore where friends of yore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Linger an' watch for me.</span><br />
Sometimes I've heered 'em callin'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So tender-like 'nd low</span><br />
That it almost seemed like a dream I dreamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or an echo of long ago;</span><br />
An' sometimes on my forehead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There falls a soft caress,</span><br />
Or the touch of a hand,&mdash;you understand,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'm gettin' on, I guess.</span><br />

<h2>THE SCHNELLEST ZUG.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
FROM Hanover to Leipzig is but a little way,<br />
Yet the journey by the so-called schnellest zug consumes a day;<br />
You start at half-past ten or so, and not till nearly night<br />
Do the double towers of Magdeburg loom up before your sight;<br />
From thence to Leipzig 's quick enough,&mdash;of that I'll not complain,&mdash;<br />
But from Hanover to Magdeburg&mdash;confound that schnellest train!<br />
<br />
The Germans say that "schnell" means fast, and "schnellest" faster yet,&mdash;<br />
In all my life no grimmer bit of humor have I met!<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>Why, thirteen miles an hour 's the greatest speed they ever go,<br />
While on the engine piston-rods do moss and lichens grow;<br />
And yet the average Teuton will presumptuously maintain<br />
That one <i>can't</i> know what swiftness is till he's tried das schnellest train!<br />
<br />
Fool that I was! I should have walked,&mdash;I had no time to waste;<br />
The little journey I had planned I had to do in haste,&mdash;<br />
The quaint old town of Leipzig with its literary mart,<br />
And Dresden with its crockery-shops and wondrous wealth of art,<br />
The Saxon Alps, the Carlsbad cure for all dyspeptic pain,&mdash;<br />
These were the ends I had in view when I took that schnellest train.<br />
<br />
The natives dozed around me, yet none too deep to hear<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>The guard's sporadic shout of "funf minuten" (meaning beer);<br />
I counted forty times at least that voice announce the stops<br />
Required of those fat natives to glut their greed for hops,<br />
Whilst <i>I</i> crouched in a corner, a monument to woe,<br />
And thought unholy, awful things, and felt my whiskers grow!<br />
And then, the wretched sights one sees while travelling by that train,&mdash;<br />
The women doing men-folks' work at harvesting the grain,<br />
Or sometimes grubbing in the soil, or hitched to heavy carts<br />
Beside the family cow or dog, doing their slavish parts!<br />
The husbands strut in soldier garb,&mdash;indeed <i>they</i> were too vain<br />
To let creation see <i>them</i> work from that creeping schnellest train!<br />
<br />
I found the German language all too feeble to convey<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>The sentiments that surged through my dyspeptic hulk that day;<br />
I had recourse to English, and exploded without stint<br />
Such virile Anglo-Saxon as would never do in print,<br />
But which assuaged my rising gorge and cooled my seething brain<br />
While snailing on to Magdeburg upon that schnellest train.<br />
<br />
The typical New England freight that maunders to and fro,<br />
The upper Mississippi boats, the bumptious B. &amp; O.,<br />
The creeping Southern railroads with their other creeping things,<br />
The Philadelphy cable that is run out West for rings,<br />
The Piccadilly 'buses with their constant roll and shake,&mdash;<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>All have I tried, and yet I'd give the "schnellest zug" the cake!<br />
My countrymen, if ever you should seek the German clime,<br />
Put not your trust in Baedeker if you are pressed for time;<br />
From Hanover to Magdeburg is many a weary mile<br />
By "schnellest zug," but done afoot it seems a tiny while;<br />
Walk, swim, or skate, and then the task will not appear in vain,<br />
But you'll break the third commandment if you take the schnellest train!<br />
</div></div>

<h2>BETHLEHEM-TOWN.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
AS I was going to Bethlehem-town,<br />
Upon the earth I cast me down<br />
All underneath a little tree<br />
That whispered in this wise to me:<br />
"Oh, I shall stand on Calvary<br />
And bear what burthen saveth thee!"<br />
<br />
As up I fared to Bethlehem-town,<br />
I met a shepherd coming down,<br />
And thus he quoth: "A wondrous sight<br />
Hath spread before mine eyes this night,&mdash;<br />
An angel host most fair to see,<br />
That sung full sweetly of a tree<br />
That shall uplift on Calvary<br />
What burthen saveth you and me!"<br />
<br />
And as I gat to Bethlehem-town,<br />
Lo! wise men came that bore a crown.<br />
"Is there," cried I, "in Bethlehem<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>A King shall wear this diadem?"<br />
"Good sooth," they quoth, "and it is He<br />
That shall be lifted on the tree<br />
And freely shed on Calvary<br />
What blood redeemeth us and thee!"<br />
<br />
Unto a Child in Bethlehem-town<br />
The wise men came and brought the crown;<br />
And while the infant smiling slept,<br />
Upon their knees they fell and wept;<br />
But, with her babe upon her knee,<br />
Naught recked that Mother of the tree,<br />
That should uplift on Calvary<br />
What burthen saveth all and me.<br />
<br />
Again I walk in Bethlehem-town<br />
And think on Him that wears the crown.<br />
I may not kiss His feet again,<br />
Nor worship Him as did I then;<br />
My King hath died upon the tree,<br />
And hath outpoured on Calvary<br />
What blood redeemeth you and me!<br />

<h2>THE PEACE OF CHRISTMAS-TIME.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
DEAREST, how hard it is to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all is for the best,</span><br />
Since, sometimes, in a grievous way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's will is manifest.</span><br />
<br />
See with what hearty, noisy glee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our little ones to-night</span><br />
Dance round and round our Christmas-tree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With pretty toys bedight.</span><br />
<br />
Dearest, one voice they may not hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One face they may not see,&mdash;</span><br />
Ah, what of all this Christmas cheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Cometh to you and me?</span><br />
<br />
Cometh before our misty eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That other little face;</span><br />
And we clasp, in tender, reverent wise,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">That love in the old embrace.</span><br />
<br />
Dearest, the Christ-Child walks to-night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bringing His peace to men;</span><br />
And He bringeth to you and to me the light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the old, old years again:</span><br />
<br />
Bringeth the peace of long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When a wee one clasped your knee</span><br />
And lisped of the morrow,&mdash;dear one, you know,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And here come back is he!</span><br />
<br />
Dearest, 'tis sometimes hard to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That all is for the best,</span><br />
For, often in a grievous way,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's will is manifest.</span><br />
<br />
But in the grace of this holy night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bringeth us back our child,</span><br />
Let us see that the ways of God are right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so be reconciled.</span><br />

<h2>THE DOINGS OF DELSARTE.</h2>


<div class='poem2'><div class='cap'>
IN former times my numerous rhymes excited general mirth,<br />
And I was then of all good men the merriest man on earth;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And my career</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">From year to year</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Was full of cheer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">And things,</span><br />
Despite a few regrets, perdieu! which grim dyspepsia brings;<br />
But now how strange and harsh a change has come upon the scene!<br />
Horrors appall the life where all was formerly so serene:<br />
Yes, wasting care hath cast its snare about my honest heart,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>Because, alas! it hath come to pass my daughter's learned Delsarte.<br />
In flesh and joint and every point the counterpart of me,<br />
She grew so fast she grew at last a marvellous thing to see,&mdash;<br />
Long, gaunt, and slim, each gangling limb played stumbling-block to t'other,<br />
The which excess of awkwardness quite mortified her mother.<br />
Now, as for me, I like to see the carriages uncouth<br />
Which certify to all the shy, unconscious age of youth.<br />
If maidenkind be pure of mind, industrious, tidy, smart,<br />
What need that they should fool away their youth upon Delsarte?<br />
<br />
In good old times my numerous rhymes occasioned general mirth,<br />
But now you see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Revealed in me</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 9em;">The gloomiest bard on earth.</span><br />
I sing no more of the joys of yore that marked my happy life,<br />
But rather those depressing woes with which the present's rife.<br />
Unreconciled to that gaunt child, who's now a fashion-plate,<br />
One song I raise in Art's dispraise, and so do I fight with Fate:<br />
This gangling bard has found it hard to see his counterpart<br />
Long, loose, and slim, divorced from him by that hectic dude, Delsarte.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Where'er she goes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">She loves to pose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">In classic attitudes,</span><br />
And droop her eyes in languid wise, and feign abstracted moods;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">And she, my child,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Who all so wild,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7.5em;">So helpless and so sweet,</span><br />
That once she knew not what to do with those great big hands and feet,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>Now comes and goes with such repose, so calmly sits or stands,<br />
Is so discreet with both her feet, so deft with both her hands.<br />
Why, when I see that satire on me, I give an angry start,<br />
And I utter one word&mdash;it is commonly heard&mdash;derogatory to Delsarte.<br />
<br />
In years gone by 't was said that I was quite a scrumptious man;<br />
Conceit galore had I before this Delsarte craze began;<br />
But now these wise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Folks criticise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">My figure and my face,</span><br />
And I opine they even incline to sneer at my musical bass.<br />
Why, sometimes they presume to say this wart upon my cheek<br />
Is not refined, and remarks unkind they pass on that antique,&mdash;<br />
With lusty bass and charms of face and figure will I part<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>Ere they extort this grand old wart to placat their Delsarte.<br />
<br />
Oh, wretched day! as all shall say who've known my Muse before,<br />
When by this rhyme you see that I'm not in it any more.<br />
Good-by the mirth that over earth diffused such keen delight;<br />
The old-time bard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of pork and lard</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">Is plainly out of sight.</span><br />
All withered now about his brow the laurel fillets droop,<br />
While Lachesis brews<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For the poor old Muse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8.5em;">A portion of scalding soup.</span><br />
Engrave this line, O friends of mine! over my broken heart:<br />
"He hustled and strove, and fancied he throve, till his daughter learned Delsarte."<br />

<h2>BUTTERCUP, POPPY, FORGET-ME-NOT.</h2>


<div class='poem'><div class='cap'>
Buttercup, Poppy, Forget-me-not,&mdash;<br />
These three bloomed in a garden spot;<br />
And once, all merry with song and play,<br />
A little one heard three voices say:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Shine or shadow, summer or spring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O thou child with the tangled hair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And laughing eyes, we three shall bring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Each an offering, passing fair!"</span><br />
The little one did not understand;<br />
But they bent and kissed the dimpled hand.<br />
<br />
Buttercup gambolled all day long,<br />
Sharing the little one's mirth and song;<br />
Then, stealing along on misty gleams,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>Poppy came, bringing the sweetest dreams,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Playing and dreaming, that was all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till once the sleeper would not awake;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kissing the little face under the pall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We thought of the words the third flower spake,</span><br />
And we found, betimes, in a hallowed spot,<br />
The solace and peace of Forget-me-not.<br />
<br />
Buttercup shareth the joy of day,<br />
Glinting with gold the hours of play;<br />
Bringeth the Poppy sweet repose,<br />
When the hands would fold and the eyes would close.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And after it all,&mdash;the play and the sleep</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of a little life,&mdash;what cometh then?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the hearts that ache and the eyes that weep,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A wee flower bringeth God's peace again:</span><br />
Each one serveth its tender lot,&mdash;<br />
Buttercup, Poppy, Forget-me-not.<br />
